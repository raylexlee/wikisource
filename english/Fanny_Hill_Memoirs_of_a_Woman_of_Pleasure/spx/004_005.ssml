        <break time="100ms" />I expected then, but without wishing it, that he would draw; but was pleasingly disappointed, for he was not to be let off so. The well breath'd youth, hot-mettl'd, and flush with genial juices, was now fairly in for making me know my driver: as soon then as he had made a short pause, waking as it were out of the trance of pleasure, (in which every sense seem'd lost for a while, whilst, with his eyes shut, and short quick breathings, he had yielded down his maiden tribute;) he still kept his post, yet unsated with enjoyment, and solacing in these so new delights, till his stiffness, which had scarce perceptibly remitted, being throughly recover'd to him, who had not once unsheath'd, he proceeded afresh to cleave and open to himself an entire entry into me, which was not a little made easy to him by the balsamic injection, with which he had just plentifully moisten'd the whole internals of the passage; redoubling then the active energy of his thrusts, favour'd by the fervid appetency of my motions, the soft oil'd wards can no longer stand so effectual a picklock, but yield, and open him an entrance: and now with conspiring nature, and my industry, strong to aid him, he pierces, penetrates, and at length, winning his way inch by inch, gets entirely in, and finally, a home-made thrust, sheaths it up to the guard; on the information of which, from the close jointure of our bodies, (insomuch that the hair on both sides perfectly interweav'd, and incircl'd, together), the eyes of the transported youth sparkl'd with more joyous fires, and all his looks and motions acknowledg'd excess of pleasure, which I now began to share, for I felt him in my very vitals! I was quite sick with delight! stir'd beyond bearing with its furious agitations within me, and gorg'd and cram'd even to surfeit: thus I lay gasping, panting, under him, till his broken breathings, faltering accents, eyes twinkling with humid fires, lunges more furious, and an encreased stiffness, gave me to hail the approaches of the second period:——it came,—— and the sweet youth, overpower'd with the extasy, died away in my arms, melting in a flood, that shot in genial warmth into the innermost recesses of my body, every conduit of which, dedicated to that pleasure, was on flow to mix with it: thus we continu'd for some instants, lost, breathless, senseless of every thing, and in every part, but those favourite ones of nature, in which all that we enjoy'd of life and sensation, was now totally concenter'd.<break time="100ms" />When our mutual trance was a little over, and the young fellow had withdrawn that delicious stretcher, with which he had most plentifully drown'd all thoughts of revenge, in the sense of actual pleasure, the widen'd wounded passage refunded a stream of pearly liquids, which flow'd down my thighs, mix'd with streaks of blood the marks of the ravage of that monstrous machine of his, which had now triumph'd over a kind of second maiden-head: I stole, however, my handkerchief to those parts, and wip'd them as dry as I could, whilst he was re-adjusting and buttoning up.<break time="100ms" />I made him now sit down by me, and as he had gather'd courage from such extreme intimacy, he gave me an aftercourse of pleasure, in a natural burst of tender gratitude and joy, at the new scenes of bliss I had open'd to him: scenes positively so new, that he had never before had the least acquaintance with that mysterious mark, the cloven stamp of female distinction, tho' nobody better qualify'd than he to penetrate into its deepest recesses, or do it nobler justice; but when by certain motions, certain unquietnesses of his hands, that wander'd not without design, I found he languish'd for satisfying a curiosity, natural enough, to view and handle those parts which attract and concentre the warmest force of imagination, charm'd as I was to have any occasion of obliging and humouring his young desires, I suffer'd him to proceed as he pleas'd, without check or controul, to the satisfaction of them.<break time="100ms" />Easily then reading in my eyes the full permission of myself to all his wishes, he scarce pleas'd himself more than me, when having insinuated his hand under my petticoat and shift, he presently remov'd those bars to the sight, by slily lifting them upwards, under favour of a thousand kisses, which he thought, perhaps, necessary to divert my attention to what he was about. All my drapery being now roll'd up to my waist, I threw myself into such a posture upon the couch, as gave up to him, in full view, the whole region of delight, and all the luxurious landscape round it. The transported youth devour'd every thing with his eyes, and try'd with his fingers to lay more open to his sight the secrets of that dark and delicious deep: he opens the folding lips, the softness of which yielding entry to any thing of a hard body, close round it, and oppose the sight: and feeling further, meets with, and wonders at, a soft fleshy excrescence, which, limber and relax'd after the late enjoyment, now grew, under the touch and examination of his fiery fingers, more and more stiff and considerable, till the titillating ardours of that so sensible part, made me sigh, as if he had hurt me. On which he withdrew his curious probing fingers, asking me pardon, as it were, in a kiss that rather increas'd the flame there.<break time="100ms" />Novelty ever makes the strongest impressions, and in pleasures especially: no wonder then, that he was swallow'd up in raptures of admiration of things so interesting by their nature, and now seen and handled for the first time. On my part, I was richly overpaid for the pleasure I gave him, in that of examining the power of those objects thus abandon'd to him, naked, and free to his loosest wish, over the artless, natural stripling: his eyes streaming fire, his cheeks glowing with a florid red, his fervid frequent sighs, whilst his hands convulsively squeez'd, opened, press'd together again the lips and sides of that deep flesh-wound, or gently twitch'd the over-growing moss; and all proclaim'd the excess, the riot of joys, in having his wantonness thus humour'd. But he did not long abuse my patience, for the objects before him had now put him by all his, and coming out with that formidable machine of his, he lets the fury loose, and pointing it directly to the pouting-lipt mouth, that bid him sweet defiance in dumb-shew, squeezes in the head, and driving with refresh'd rage, breaks in, and plugs up the whole passage of that soft-pleasure-conduit, where he makes all shake again, and put once more all within me into such an uproar, as nothing could still, but a fresh inundation from the very engine of those flames, as well as from all the springs with which nature floats that recevoir of joy, when risen to its flood-mark.
