        <break time="100ms" />The frolic was now come round to me, and it being my turn of subscription to the will and pleasure of my particular elect, as well as that of the company, he came to me, and saluting me very tenderly, with a flattering eagerness, put me in mind of the compliances my presence there authoriz'd the hopes of, and at the same time repeated to me, that if all this force of example had not surmounted any repugnance I might have to concur with the humours and desires of the company, that though the play was bespoke for my benefit, and great as his own private disappointment might be, he would suffer anything sooner than be the instrument of imposing a disagreeable task on me. To this I answer'd, without the least hesitation, or mincing grimace, that had I not even contracted a kind of engagement to be at his disposal without the least reserve, the example of such agreeable companions would alone determine me, and that I was in no pain about anything but my appearing to so great a disadvantage after such superior beauties: and take notice, that I thought as I spoke. The frankness of the answer pleas'd them all: my particular was complimented on his acquisition, and, by way of indirect flattery to me, openly envied.<break time="100ms" />Mrs. Cole, by the way, could not have given me a greater mark of her regard than in managing for me the choice of this young gentleman, for my master of the ceremonies; for independent of his noble birth, and the great fortune he was heir to; his person was even uncommonly pleasing, well shap'd and tall; his face mark'd with the small-pox, but no more than what added a grace of more manliness to features, rather turn'd to softness, and delicacy, was marvellously enliven'd by eyes which were of the clearest sparkling black; in short, he was one whom any woman would, in the familiar style, readily call a very pretty fellow.<break time="100ms" />I was now handed by him to the cockpit of our match, where, as I was dress'd in nothing but a white morning gown, he vouchsafed to play the male-Abigal on the occasion, and spar'd me the confusion that would have attended the forwardness of undressing myself: my gown then was loosen'd in a trice, and I divested of it: my stays next offer'd an obstacle which quickly gave way, Louisa very readily furnishing a pair of scissars to cut the lace: off went that shell; and dropping my upper-coat, I was now reduc'd to my under-one, and my shift, the open bosom of which gave the hands, and eyes all the liberty they could wish: here I imagin'd the stripping was to stop; but I reckon'd short: my spark, at the desire of the rest, tenderly beg'd, that I would not suffer the small remains of a covering to rob them of a full view of my whole person: and for me, who was too flexibly obsequious to dispute any point with them, and who consider'd the little more that remain'd as very immaterial, I readily assented to whatever he pleas'd. In an instant, then, my under petticoat was untied, and at my feet, and my shift drawn over my head, so that my cap, slightly fasten'd, came off with it, and brought all my hair down (of which be it again remember'd without vanity, that I had a very fine head) in loose disorderly ringlets, over my neck and shoulders, to no unfavourable set-off of my skin.<break time="100ms" />I now stood, before my judges in all the truth of nature, to whom I could not appear a very disagreeable figure, if you please to recollect what I have before said of my person, which time, that at certain periods of life, robs us every instant of our charms, had, at that of mine, then greatly improv'd into full and open bloom, for I wanted some months of eighteen: my breasts, which in the state of nudity are ever capital points, now in no more than grateful plenitude, maintain'd a firmness and steady independence on any stay or support, that dared and invited the test of the touch. Then I was as tall, as slim shap'd as could be consistent with all that juicy plumpness of flesh ever the most grateful to the senses of sight and touch, which I owed to the health and youth of my constitution. I had not, however, so thoroughly renounc'd all innate shame, as not to suffer great confusion at the state I saw myself in: but the whole troop round me, men and women, reliev'd me with every mark of applause and satisfaction, every flattering attention to raise, and inspire me with even sentiments of pride on the figure I made, which my friend gallantly protested, infinitely out-shone all other birth-day finery whatever, so that had I leave to set down, for sincere, all the compliments these connoisseurs over-whelm'd me with upon this occasion, I might flatter myself with having pass'd my examination, with approbation of the learned.<break time="100ms" />My friend however, who for this time had alone the disposal of me, humour'd their curiosity, and perhaps his own, so far that he plac'd me in all the variety of postures and lights imaginable, pointing out every beauty under every aspect of it, not without such parentheses of kisses, such inflammatory liberties of his roving hands, as made all shame fly before them, and a blushing glow give place to a warmer one of desire, which led me even to find some relish in the present scene.<break time="100ms" />But in this general survey, you may be sure, the most material spot of me was not excus'd the strictest visitation: nor was it but agreed, that I had not the least reason to be diffident of passing even for a maid, on occasion; so inconsiderable a flaw had my preceding adventures created there, and so soon had the blemish of an over-stretch been repair'd and worn out, at my age, and in my naturally small make in that part.
