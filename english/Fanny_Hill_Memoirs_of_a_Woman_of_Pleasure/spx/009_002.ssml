        <break time="100ms" />Mr. Barvile, no stranger, by experience, to these situations, soon knew the pass I was brought to; soon perceiv'd my extreme disorder; in favour of which, removing the table out of the way, he began a prelude that flatter'd me with instant relief, which I was not however so near as I imagin'd: for as he was unbutton'd to me, and tried to provoke, and rouse to action his unactive, torpid machine, he blushingly own'd, that no good was to be expected from it, unless I took in hand to re-excite it's languid, loitering powers, by just refreshing the smart of the yet recent, blood-raw cuts, seeing it could, no more than a boy's top, keep up without lashing: sensible then, that I should work as much for my own profit as his, I hurried my compliance with his desire, and abridging the ceremonial, whilst he lean'd his head against the back of a chair, I had scarce gently made him feel the lash, before I saw the object of my wishes give signs of life, and presently, as it were with a magic touch, it started up into a noble size, and distinction indeed! hastening then to give me the benefit of it, he threw me down on the bench; but such was the refresh'd soreness of those parts behind, on my leaning so hard on them as became me to compass the admission of that stupendous head of his machine, that I could not possibly bear it: I got up then, and tried, by leaning forwards, and turning the crupper on my assailant, to let him in at the back-avenue; but here it was likewise impossible to stand his bearing so fiercely against me in his agitations, and endeavours to enter that way, whilst his belly batter'd directly against the recent sore: what should we do now? both intolerably heated! both all in one fury! but pleasure is ever inventive for its own ends: he strips me in a trice, stark naked, and placing a broad settee-cushion on the carpet before the fire, oversets me gently topsy-turvy on it; and handling me only at the waist, whilst you may be sure I favour'd all his dispositions, brought my legs round his neck; so that my head was kept from the floor only by my hands, and the velvet cushion, which was now bespread with my flowing hair; thus I stood on my head and hands, supported by him in such manner, that whilst my thighs clung round him, so as to expose, to his sight all my back-figure, including the theatre of his bloody pleasure, the center of my forepart fairly bearded the now worthy object of its rage, that now stood in fine condition to give me satisfaction for the injuries of its neighbours. But as this posture was certainly not the easiest, and our imagination, wound up to the heighth, could suffer no delay; he first, with the utmost eagerness and effort, just lip-lodg'd that broad, acorn-fashion'd head of his instrument; and still friended by the fury with which he had made that impression, he soon stuffed in the rest; when now, with a pursuit of thrusts fiercely urg'd, he absolutely overpower'd, and absorb'd all sense of pain and uneasiness, whether from my wounds behind, my most untoward posture, or the oversize of his stretcher, in an infinitely predominat delight: when now all my whole spirits of life and sensation, rushing impetuously to the cock-pit, where the prize of pleasure was hotly in dispute, and clustering to a point there, I soon receiv'd the dear relief of nature from these over-violent strains and provocations of it, harmonizing with which, my gallant spouted into me such a potent overflow of the oily balsamic injection, as soften'd and unedg'd all those irritating stings of a new species of titilation, which I had been so untolerably madden'd with, and restor'd the ferment of my senses to some degree of composure.<break time="100ms" />I had now atchiev'd this rare adventure, ultimately much more to my satisfaction than I had bespoke the nature of it to turn out, nor was it much lessen'd, you may think, by my spark's lavish praises of my constancy and complaisance, which he gave weight to by a present that greatly passed my utmost expectation: besides his gratification to Mrs. Cole.<break time="100ms" />I was not however, at any time reintic'd to renew with him, or resort again to the violent expedient of lashing nature into more hast than good speed, which by the way, I conceive acts somewhat in the manner of a dose of Spanish flies, with more pain perhaps, but less danger, and might be necessary to him; but was nothing less so, than to me, whose appetites wanted the bridle more than the spur.<break time="100ms" />Mrs. Cole, to whom this adventrous exploit had more and more endear'd me, look'd on me now as a girl after her own heart, afraid of nothing; and, on a good account, hardy enough to fight all the weapons of pleasure through. Attentive then, in consequence of these favourable conceptions, to promote either my profit or pleasure, she had special regard for the first, in a new gallant of a very singular turn, that she procur'd for, and introduc'd to me.<break time="100ms" />This was a grave, staid, solemn, elderly gentleman, whose peculiar humour was a delight in combing fine tresses of hair, and as I was perfe√≥tly headed to his taste, he us'd to come constantly at my toilette hours, when I let down my hair as loose as nature; and abandon'd it to him, to do what he pleas'd with it; and accordingly he would keep me an hour, or more, in play with it, drawing the comb through it, winding the curls round his fingers, even kissing it as he smooth'd it, and all this led to no other use of my person, or any other liberties whatever, any more than if a distinction of sexes had not existed,<break time="100ms" />Another peculiarity of taste he had, which was to present me at once with a dozen pair of the whitest kid-gloves at a time: these he would divert himself with drawing on me, and then biting off their fingers ends; all which fooleries of a sickly appetite, the old gentleman paid more liberally for, than most others did for more essential favours. This lasted till a violent cough seizing and laying him up, deliver'd me from this most innocent, and most insipid trifler; for I never heard more of him, after his first retreat.<break time="100ms" />You may be sure a by-job of this sort interfer'd with no other pursuit, or plan of life, which I led in truth with a modesty and reserve that was less the work of virtue, than of exhausted novelty, a glut of pleasure, and easy circumstances, that made me indifferent to any engagements in which pleasure and profit were not eminently united; and such I could with the less impatience wait for at the hands of time and fortune, as I was satisfied I could never mend my pennyworths, having evidently been serv'd at the top of the market, and even been pamper'd with dainties; besides that, in the sacrifice of a few momentary impulses, I found a secret satisfaction in respecting myself, as well as preserving the life and freshness of my complexion. Louisa and Emila did not carry indeed their reserve as high as I did, but still they were far from cheap or abandon'd, though two of their adventures adventures seem'd to contradict this general character, which for their singularity I shall give you in course, beginning first with Emily's
