        <break time="100ms" /><break time="100ms" />Louisa too herself did not long outstay this adventure, at Mrs. Cole's (to whom, by the bye, we took care not to boast of our exploit, till all fear of consequences was clearly over:) for, an occasion presenting itself of proving her passion for a young fellow, at the expence of her discretion, proceeding all in character, she pack'd up her toilette, at half a day's warning, and went with him abroad, since which I lost entirely sight of her, and it never fell in my way to hear what became of her.<break time="100ms" />But a few days after she had left us, two very pretty young gentlemen, who were Mrs. Cole's especial favourites, and free of her academy, easily obtain'd her consent for Emily's and my acceptance of a party of pleasure, at a little, but agreeable house, belonging to one of them, situate not far up the river Thames, on the Surry side.<break time="100ms" />Every thing being settled, and it being a fine summer-day, but rather of the warmest, we set out after dinner, and got to our rendezvous, about four in the afternoon, where landing at the foot of a neat, joyous pavilion, Emily and I were handed into it, by our Squires, and there drank tea with a chearfulness and gaiety, that the beauty of the prospect, the serenity of the weather, and the tender politeness of our sprightly gallants, naturally led us into.<break time="100ms" />After tea, and taking a turn in the garden, my particular, who was the master of the house, and had in no sense schem'd this party of pleasure for a dry one; propos'd to us, with that frankness which his familiarity at Mrs. Cole's entitled him to, as the weather was excessive hot, to bathe together, under a commodious shelter that he had prepar'd expresly for that purpose, in a creek of the river, with which a side-door of the pavilion immediately communicated, and where we might be sure of having our diversion out, safe from interruption, and with the utmost privacy.<break time="100ms" />Emily, who never refus'd any thing, and I, who ever delighted in bathing, and had no exception to the person who propos'd it, or to those pleasures it was easy to guess it implied, took care, on this occasion, not to wrong our training at Mrs. Cole's, and agreed to it, with as good a grace as we could. Upon which, without loss of time, we return'd instantly to the pavilion, one door of which open'd into a tent, pitch'd before it, that with its Marquise, form'd a pleasing defence against the sun, or the weather, and was besides as private as we could wish. The lining of it, imbost cloth, represented a wild forest-foliage, from the top, down to the sides, which, in the same stuff, were figur'd with fluted pilasters, with their spaces between fill'd with flower-vases, the whole having a gay effect upon the eye, wherever you turn'd it.<break time="100ms" />Then it reach'd sufficiently into the water, yet contain'd convenient benches round it, on the dry ground, either to keep our cloaths, or,—or,—in short, for more uses than resting upon. There was a side-table too, loaded with sweatmeats, jellies, and other eatables, and bottles of wine and cordials, by way of occasional relief from any rawness, or chill of the water, or from any faintness from whatever cause: and, in fact, my gallant who understood chere entiere perfectly, and who for taste (even if you would not approve this specimen of it) might have been comptroller of pleasures to a Roman emperor, had left no requisite towards convenience, or luxury unprovided.<break time="100ms" />As soon as we had look'd round this inviting spot, and every preliminary of privacy was duly settled: strip, was the word: when the young gentlemen soon dispatch'd the undressing each his partner, and reduc'd us to the naked confession of all those secrets of person, which dress generally hides, and which the discovery of, was, naturally speaking, not to our disadvantage. Our hands indeed machinally carried towards the most interesting part of us, skreen'd at first all from the tufted cliff downwards, till we took them away, at their desire, and employ'd them, in doing them the same office, of helping them off with their cloaths, in the process of which, there past all the little wantonnesses, and frolic, that you may easily imagine.<break time="100ms" />As for my spark, he was presently undrest, all to his shirt, the fore-lappet of which, as he lean'd languishingly on me, he smilingly pointed to me, to observe, as it bellied out, or rose, and fell, according to the unruly starts of the motion behind it: but it was soon fix'd; for now taking off his shirt, and naked as a Cupid, he show'd it meat so upright a stand, as prepar'd me indeed for his application to me for instant ease: but tho' the sight of its fine size was fit enough to fire me; the cooling air, as I stood in this state of nature, join'd to the desire I had of bathing first, enabled me to put him off, and tranquillize him, with the remark, that a little suspense would only set a keener edge on the pleasure: leading then the way, and showing our friends an example of continency, which they were giving signs of losing respect to, we went, hand in hand, into the stream, till it took us up to our neck, where, the no more than grateful coolness of the water, gave my senses a delicious refreshment from the sultryness of the season, and made me more alive, more happy in myself, and, in course, more alert, and open to voluptuous impressions.<break time="100ms" />Here I lav'd and wanton'd with the water, or sportively play'd with my companion, leaving Emily to deal with hers at discretion. Mine, at length, not content with making me take the plunge over head and ears, kept splashing me, and provoking me by all the little playful tricks he could devise, and which I strove not to remain in his debt for. We gave, in short, a loose to mirth: and now, nothing would serve him but giving his hands the regale of going over every part of me, neck, breast, belly, thighs, and all the sweet et cetera, so dear to the imagination; under the pretext of washing, and rubbing them; as, we both stood in the water, no higher now than the pit of our stomachs, and which did not hinder him from feeling and toying with that leak that distinguishes our sex, and is so wonderfully water-tight: for his fingers, in vain dilating and opening it, only let more flame than water into it, be it said, without a figure: at the same time he made me feel his own engine, which was so well wound up, as to stand even the working in water, and he accordingly threw one arm round my neck, and was endeavouring to get the better of that harsher constriction bred by the surrounding fluid, and had in effect won his way so far as to make me sensible of the pleasing stretch of those nether-lips, from the in-driving machine, when, independent of my not liking that aukward mode of enjoyment, I could not help interrupting him, in order to become joint spectators of a plan of joy, in hot operation between Emily and her partner, who impatient of the fooleries, and dalliance of the bath, had led his nymph to one of the benches on the green bank, where he was very cordially proceeding to teach her the difference betwixt jest and earnest.
