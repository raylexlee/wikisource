        <break time="100ms" />Her gallant began first, as she stood, to disingage her breasts, and restore them to the liberty of nature, from the easy confinement of no more than a pair of jumps; but on their coming out to view, we thought a new light was added to the room, so superiourly shining was their whiteness; then they rose in so happy a swell as to compose her a well-form'd fullness of bosom, that had such an effect on the eye as to seem flesh hardening into marble, of which it emulated the polish'd glass, and far surpass'd even the whitest, in the life and lustre of its colours, white vein'd with blue. Refrain who could from such provoking enticements to it in reach? He touch'd her breasts first lightly, when the glossy smoothness of the skin eluded his hand, and made it slip along the surface: he press'd them, and the springy flesh that fill'd them, thus pitted by force, rose again reboundingly with his hand, and on the instant effac'd the dint of the pressure: and alike indeed was the consistence of all those parts of her body throughout, where the fullness of flesh compacts and constitutes all that fine firmness which the touch is so highly attach'd to. When he had thus largely pleas'd himself with this branch of dalliance, and delight, he truss'd up her petticoat and shift, in a wisp to her waist, where being tuck'd in, she stood fairly naked on every side: a blush at this overspread her lovely face, and her eyes, down cast to the ground, seem'd to beg for quarter, when she had so great a right to triumph in all the treasures of youth and beauty that she now so victoriously display'd. Her legs were perfectly well shap'd, and her thighs, which she kept pretty close, showed so white, so round, so substantial, and abounding in firm flesh, that nothing could offer a stronger recommendation to the luxury of the touch, which he accordingly did not fail to indulge himself in: then gently removing her hand, which in the first emotion of natural modesty, she had carried thither, he gave us rather a glimpse than a view of that soft narrow chink, running its little length downwards, and hiding the remains of it between her thighs: but plain was to be seen the fringe of light-brown curls, in beauteous growth over it, that with their silky gloss created a pleasing variety from the surrounding white, whose lustre too, their gentle embrowning shade considerably raised. Her spark then endeavour'd, as she stood, by disclosing her thighs, to gain us a compleater sight of that central charm of attraction, but not obtaining it so conveniently in that attitude, he led her to the foot of the couch, and bringing to it one of the pillows, gently inclin'd her head down, so that as she lean'd with it over her crossed hands, straddling with her thighs wide spread, and jutting her body out, she presented a full back-view of her person, naked to her waist. Her posteriours, plump, smooth, and prominent, form'd luxuriant tracts of animated snow, that splendidly fill'd the eye, till it was commanded down the parting or separation of those exquisitely white cliffs, by their narrow vale, and was there stopt, and attracted by the embower'd bottom cavity, that terminated this delightful visto, and stood moderately gaping from the influence of her bended posture, so that the agreeable interior red of the sides of the orifice came into view, and with respect to the white that dazzl'd round it, gave somewhat the idea of a pink-slash in the glossiest white sattin. Her gallant, who was a gentle man about thirty, of an immense fortune, somewhat inclin'd to a fatness that was in no sort displeasing, improving the hint thus tender'd him of this mode of enjoiment, after settling her well in this posture and encouraging her with kisses and caresses to stand him through, drew out his affair ready erected, and whose extreme length, rather disproportion'd to its breadth, was the more surprising, as that excess is not often the case of those of his corpulent habit; making then the right and direct application, he drove it up to the guard, whilst the round bulge of those Turkish beauties of her's tallying with the hollow made by the bent of his belly and thighs, as they curv'd inwards, brought all those parts, surely not undelightfully, into warm touch, and close conjunction: his hands he kept pass'd round her body, and employ'd in toying with her inchanting breasts: as soon too as she felt him as home as he could reach, she lifted her head a little from the pillow, and turning her neck, without much straining, but her cheeks glowing with the deepest scarlet, and a smile of the tenderest satisfaction, met the kiss he press'd forward to give her, as they were thus close join'd together: when leaving him to pursue his delights, she hid again her face and blushes, with her hands and pillow, and thus stood passively and as favourably too as she could, whilst he kept laying at her with repeated thrusts, and making the meeting flesh on both sides resound again with the violence of them: then ever as he backen'd from her, we could see between them part of his long white-staff foamingly in motion, till, as he went on again, and closed with her, the interposing hillocs took it out of sight: sometimes he took his hands from the semi-globes of her bosom, and transferr'd the pressure of them to those larger ones, the present subjects of his soft blockade, which he squeez'd, grasp'd, and play'd with, till at length a pursuit of driving so hotly urg'd, brought on the heigth of the fit, with such symptoms of overpowering pleasure, that his fair partner became now necessary to support him, panting, fainting, and dying as he discharg'd, which she no sooner felt the killing sweetness of, than unable to keep her legs, and yielding to the mighty intoxication, she reel'd, and falling forward on the couch, made it a necessity for him, if he would preserve the warm pleasure-hold, to fall upon her, where they perfected, in a continu'd conjunction of body, and extatic flow, their scheme of joys for that time.<break time="100ms" />As soon as he had disengag'd, the charming Emily got up, and we crouded round her with congratulations, and other officious little services; for it is to be noted, that though all modesty and reserve were banish'd the transaction of these pleasures, good manners and politeness were inviolably observ'd: here was no gross ribaldry, no offensive or rude behaviour, or ungenerous reproaches to the girls for their compliance with the humours, and desires of the men. On the contrary, nothing was wanting to sooth, encourage, and soften the sense of their condition to them. Men know not in general how mnch they destroy of their own pleasure, when they break through the respect and tenderness due to our sex, and even to those of it who live only by pleasing pleasing them. And this was a maxim perfectly well understood by these polite voluptuaries, these profound adepts in the great art and science of pleasure, who never shew'd these votaries of theirs a more tender respect than at the time of those exercises of their complaisance, when they unlock'd their treasures of conceal'd beauty, and show'd out in the pride of their native charms, ever-more touching surely than when they parade it in the artificial ones of dress and ornament.
