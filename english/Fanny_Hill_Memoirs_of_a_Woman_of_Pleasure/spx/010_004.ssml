        <break time="100ms" />Referring then to a more explicit narrative, to explain by what progressions our acquaintance, certainly innocent, at first, insensibly changed nature, and ran into unplatonic lengths, as might well be expected from one of my condition of life, and above all from that principle of electricity which scarce ever fails of producing fire, when the sexes meet: I shall only here acquaint you, that as age had not subdued his tenderness for our sex, neither had it robb'd him of the power of pleasing, since whatever he wanted in the bewitching charms of youth, he atton'd for, or supplemented with the advantages of experience, the sweetness of his manners, and above all his flattering address in touching the heart by an application to the understanding. From him, it was that I first learn'd to any purpose, and not without infinite pleasure, that I had such a portion of me worth bestowing some regard on: from him I received my first essential encouragement, and instructions how to put it into that train of cultivation, which I have since pushed to the little degree of improvement you see it at: He it was, who first taught me to be sensible that the pleasures of the mind were superior to those of the body, at the same time, that they were so far from obnoxious to, or incompatible with each other, that besides the sweetness in the variety, and transition, the one serv'd to exalt and perfect the taste of the other, to a degree that the senses alone can never arrive at.<break time="100ms" />Himself a rational pleasurist, as being much too wise to be asham'd of the pleasures of humanity, lov'd me indeed, but lov'd me with dignity, in a mean equally remov'd from that sourness, or frowardness which age is unpleasingly characteris'd by, and from that childish silly dotage that so often disgraces it, and which he himself used to turn into ridicule, and compare to an old goat affecting the frisk of a young kid.<break time="100ms" />In short, every thing that is generally unamiable in his season of Life, was, in him, repair'd by so many advantages, that he existed a proof manifest, at least to me, that it is not out of the power of age to please, if it lays out to please, and if making just allowances, those in that class do not forget, that it must cost them more pains, and attention, than what youth, the natural spring-time of joy, stands in need of: as fruits out of season, require proportionably more skill and cultivation, to force them.<break time="100ms" />With this gentleman then, who took me home soon after our acquaintance commenc'd, I lived near eight months, in which time, my constant complaisance, my docility, my attention to deserve his confidence and love, and a conduct, in general, devoid of the least art, and founded on my sincere esteem, and regard for him, won, and attach'd him so firmly to me, that after having generously trusted me with a genteel, independent settlement, proceeding to heap marks of affection on me, he appoined me, by an authentick will, his sole heiress, and executrix; a disposition which he did not outlive two months, being taken from me by a violent cold that he contracted, as he unadvisedly ran to the window, on an alarm of fire, at some streets distance, and stood there naked-breasted, and expos'd to the fatal impressions of a damp night-air.<break time="100ms" />After acquitting myself of my duty towards my deceas'd benefactor, and paying him a tribute of unfeign'd sorrow, which a little time chang'd into the most tender, grateful memory of him, that I shall ever retain, I grew somewhat comforted by the prospect that now open'd to me, if not of happiness, at least of affluence, and independence.<break time="100ms" />I saw myself then, in the full bloom and pride of youth (for I was not yet nineteen) actually at the head of so large a fortune, as it would have been even the heighth of impudence in me, to have rais'd my wishes, much more my hopes, to: and that this unexpected elevation did not turn my head, I ow'd to the pains my benefactor had taken to form and prepare me for it, as I ow'd his opinion of my management of the vast possessions he left me, to what he had observ'd of the prudential Å“conomy I had learned under Mrs. Cole, of which the reserve he saw I had made, was a proof, and encouragement, to him.<break time="100ms" />But alass! how easily is the enjoyment of the greatest sweets in life, in present possession, poisoned by the regret of an absent one! but my regret was a mighty and a just one, since it had my only truly belov'd Charles for its object.<break time="100ms" />Given him up I had indeed compleatly, having never once heard from him since our separation; which as I found afterwards, had been my misfortune, and not his neglect, for he wrote me several letters which had all miscarried, but forgotten him I never had: and amidst all my personal infidelities, not one had made a pin's point impression on a heart impenetrable to the true love-passion, but for him.<break time="100ms" />As soon, however, as I was mistress of this unexpected fortune, I felt more than ever how dear he was to me: from its insufficiency to make me happy, whilst he was not to share it with me: my earliest care, consequently, was to endeavour at getting some account of him? but all my researches produc'd me no more light, than that his father had been dead some time, not so well as even with the world; and that Charles had reached his port of destination in the South-Seas, where finding the estate he was sent to recover, dwindled to a trifle, by the loss of two ships, in which the bulk of his uncle's fortune lay, he was come away with the small remainder, and might perhaps, according to the best advice, in a few months return to England, from whence he had, at the time of this my enquiry, been absent two years and seven months: a little eternity in love!<break time="100ms" />You cannot conceive with what joy I embraced the hopes thus given me of seeing the delight of my heart again; but as the term of months was assign'd it, in order to divert, and amuse my impatience for his return, after settling my affairs with much ease, and security, I set out on a journey for Lancashire, with an equipage suitable to my fortune, and with a design purely to revisit my place of nativity, for which I could not help retaining a great tenderness, and might naturally not be sorry to show myself there, to the advantage I was now in pass to do, after the report Esther Davis had spread of my being spirited away to the Plantations, for on no other supposition could she account for the suppression of myself to her, since her leaving me so abruptly at the inn. Another favourite intention I had, to look out for my relations, though I had none besides distant ones, and to prove a benefactress to them. Then Mrs. Cole's place of retirement lying in my way, was not amongst the least of the pleasures I had propos'd to myself in this expedition.<break time="100ms" />I had taken nobody with me but a discreet decent woman, to figure it as my companion, besides my servants, and was scarce got into an inn, about twenty miles from London, where I was to sup and pass the night, when such a storm of wind and rain sprang up, as made me congratulate myself on having got under shelter before it began.
