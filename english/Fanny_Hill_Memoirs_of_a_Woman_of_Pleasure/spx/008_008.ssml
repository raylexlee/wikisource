        <break time="100ms" />Next we took from the side of the room a long broad bench, made easy to lie at length on by a soft cushion in a callico-cover: and every thing being now ready, he took his coat and wastecoat off; and at his motion and desire, I unbutton'd his breeches, and rolling up his shirt rather above his waist, tuck'd it in securely there; when directing naturally my eyes to that humoursome master-movement, in whose favour all these dispositions were making, it seem'd almost shrunk into his belly, scarce shewing its tip above the sprout of hairy curls that cloath'd those parts, as you may have seen a wren peep its head out of the grass.<break time="100ms" />Stooping then to untie his garters, he gave them me for the use of tying him down to the legs of the bench, a circumstance no farther necessary than as I suppose it made part of the humour of the thing, since he prescribed it to himself, amongst the rest of the ceremonial.<break time="100ms" />I led him then to the bench, and according to my cue, plaid at forcing him to lie down: which, after some little shew of reluctance, for form-sake, he submitted to, he was straitway extended flat upon his belly, on the bench, with a pillow under his face; and as he thus tamely lay, I tied him slightly hand and foot, to the legs of it; which done, his shirt remaining truss'd up over the small of his back, I drew his breeches quite down to his knees; and now he lay, in all the fairest, broadest display of that part of the back-view, in which a pair of chubby, smooth-cheek'd, and passing white posteriours rose cushioning upwards from two stout, fleshful thighs, and ending their cleft, or separation, by an union at the small of the back, presented a bold mark, that swell'd, as it were, to meet the scourge.<break time="100ms" />Seizing now one of the rods, I stood over him, and, according to his direction, gave him, in one breath, ten lashes with much good-will, and the utmost nerve and vigour of arm that I could put to them, so as to make those fleshy orbs quiver again under them, whilst himself seem'd no more concern'd, or to mind them, than a lobster would a fleabite: in the mean time, I view'd intently the effects of them, which to me at least appear'd surprisingly cruel: every lash had skimm'd the surface of those white cliffs, which they deeply redden'd, and lapping round the side of the furthermost from me, cut, especially into the dimple of it, such livid weals, as the blood either spun out from, or stood in large drops on; and from some of the cuts I pick'd out even the splinters of the rod, that had stuck in the skin: nor was this raw work to be wonder'd at, considering the greenness of the twigs, and the severity of the infliction, whilst the whole surface of his skin was so smooth-stretch'd over the hard and firm pulp of flesh that fill'd it, as to yield no play, or elusive swagging under the stroke, which thereby took place the more plum, and cut into the quick.<break time="100ms" />I was however already so mov'd at the piteous sight, that I from my heart repented the undertaking, and would willingly have given over, thinking he had full enough; but, he encouraging, and beseeching me earnestly to proceed, I gave him ten more lashes, and then resting, survey'd the encrease of bloody appearances, and at length, steel'd to the sight, by his stoutness in suffering, I continu'd the discipline, by intervals, till I observ'd him wreathing and twisting his body in a way that I could plainly perceive was not the effect of pain, but of some new and powerful sensation; curious to dive into the meaning of which, in one of my pauses of intermission, I approach'd, as he still kept working, and grinding his belly against the cushion under him; and first, stroking the untouch'd and unhurt side of the flesh-mount next me, then softly insinuating my hand under his thigh, felt the posture things were in forwards, which was indeed surprising; for that machine of his, which I had by its appearance, taken for an impalpable, or at best a very diminutive subject, was now, in virtue of all that smart and havock of his skin behind, grown not only to a prodigious stiffness of erection, but to a size that frighted even me: a non-pareil thickness indeed! the head of it alone fill'd the utmost capacity of my grasp: and when, as he heav'd and wriggled to and fro, in the agitation of his strange pleasure, it came into view, it had some thing of the air of a round fillet of the whitest veal, like its owner, squob, and short in proportion to its breadth; but when he felt my hand there, he begg'd I would go on briskly with my jerking, or he should never arrive at the last stage of pleasure.<break time="100ms" />Resuming then the rod, and the exercise of it, I had fairly worn out three bundles, when, after an increase of struggles, and motion, and a deep sigh or two, I saw him lie still and motionless: and now he desir'd me to desist, which I instantly did, and proceeding to untie him, I could not but be amazed at his passive fortitude, on viewing the skin of his butcher'd, mangled posteriours, late so white, smooth and polish'd, now all one side of them, a confus'd cut-work of weals, livid flesh, gashes and gore, insomuch that when he stood up, he could scarce walk; in short, he was in sweet-briars.<break time="100ms" />Then I plainly perceiv'd on the cushion, the marks of a plenteous effusion of white liquid, and already had his sluggard member run up to its old nestling-place, and ensconc'd itself again, as if asham'd to show its head, which nothing, it seems, could raise but stripes inflicted on its opposite neighbours, who were thus constantly oblig'd to suffer for his caprice.<break time="100ms" />
