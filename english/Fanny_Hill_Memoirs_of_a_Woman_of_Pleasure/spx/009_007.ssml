        <break time="100ms" />Poor Louisa, however, bore up at length better than could have been expected, and though she suffer'd, and greatly too, yet ever true to the good old cause, she suffer'd with pleasure, and enjoy'd her pain: and soon now, by dint of an enrag'd enforcement, the brute machine, driven like a whirlwind, made all smoak again, and wedging its way up, to the utmost extremity, left her in point of penetration nothing either to fear, or to desire, and now,<break time="100ms" />"Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth." Shakespear<break time="100ms" />Louisa lay, pleas'd to the heart, pleas'd to her utmost capacity of being so, with every fibre in those parts, stretch'd almost to breaking, on a rack of joy, whilst the instrument of all this overfulness, search'd her senses with its sweet excess, till the pleasure gain'd upon her so, its point stung her so home, that catching at length the rage from her furious driver, and sharing the riot of his wild rapture, she went wholly out of her mind into that favourite part of her body, the whole intenseness of which was so fervorously fill'd, and employ'd: there alone she existed, all lost in those delirious transports, those extasies of the senses, which her winking eyes, the brighten'd vermilion of her lips, and cheeks, and sighs of pleasure deeply fetched, so pathetically express'd. In short, she was now as meer a machine, as much wrought on, and had her motions as little at her own command, as the natural himself, who thus broke in upon her, made her feel with a vengeance his tempestuous tenderness, and the force of mettle he batter'd with: their active loins quiver'd again with the violence of their conflict, till the surge of pleasure foaming, and raging to a height, drew down the pearly shower that was to allay this hurricane: the purely sensitive ideot then first shed those tears of joy that attend its last moments, not without an agony of delight, and even almost a roar of rapture, as the gush escap'd him, so sensibly too for Louisa, that she kept him faithful company, going off, in consent, with the old symptoms; a delicious delirium, a tremulous convulsive shudder, and the critical dying oh! And now, on his getting off, she lay pleasure-drench'd and regorging its essentials sweets: but quite spent, but gasping for breath, without other sensation of life than in those exquisite vibrations, that trembled yet on the strings of delight, which had been so ravishingly touch'd; and which nature had been too intensely stirr'd with, for the senses to be quickly at peace from.<break time="100ms" />As for the changeling, whose curious engine had been thus successfully play'd off, his shift of countenance and gesture had even something droll, or rather tragi-comic in it: There was now an air of sad, repining foolishness, superadded to his natural one of no meaning, and ideotism; as he stood with his label of manhood, now lank, unstiffen'd, becalm'd, and flapping against his thighs, down which it reached half-way, terrible even in its fall: whilst, under the dejection of spirit, and flesh, which naturally follow'd, his eyes, by turns cast down towards his struck standard, or piteously lifted to Louisa, seem'd to require at her hands what he had so sensibly parted from to her, and now ruefully missed; but the vigor of nature soon returning, dissipated this blast of faintness which the common-law of enjoyment had subjected him to; and now his basket re-became his main concern, which I look'd for, and brought him, whilst Louisa restor'd his dress to its usual condition, and afterwards pleas'd him perhaps more by taking all his flowers off his hands, and paying him at his rate, for them, than if she had embarrass'd him by a present, that he would have been puzzled to account for, and might have put others on tracing the motives of it.<break time="100ms" />Whether she ever return'd to the attack, I know not, and to say the truth, I believe not; she had had her freak out, and had pretty plentifully drowned her curiosity in a glut of pleasure, which as it happen'd had no other consequence, than that the lad, who retain'd only a confus'd memory of the transaction, would when he saw her, for some little time after, express a grin of joy, and familiarity, after his ideot manner, and soon forgot her, probably in favour of the next woman tempted on the report of his parts to take him in.<break time="100ms" />
