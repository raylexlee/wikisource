        <break time="100ms" />My lips, which I threw in his way, so as that he could not escape kissing them, fix'd, fir'd, and embolden'd him, and now glancing my eyes towards that part of his dress which cover'd the essential object of enjoyment, I plainly discover'd the swell and commotion there, and as I was now too far advanc'd to stop in so fair a way, and was indeed no longer able to contain myself, or wait the slower progress of his maiden bashfulness, (for such it seem'd, and really was) I stole my hand upon his thighs, down one of which, I could both see and feel a stiff hard body, confin'd by his breeches, that my fingers could discover no end to: curious then and eager to unfold so alarming a mystery, playing as it were with his buttons, which were bursting ripe from the active force within, those of his waist-band and fore-flap flew open at a touch, when out it started; and now, disengag'd from the shirt, I saw with wonder and surprize, what? not the play-thing of a boy, not the weapon of a man, but a may-pole of so enormous a standard, that had proportions been observ'd, it must have belong'd to a young giant: its prodigious size made me shrink again: yet! I could not without pleasure behold, and even ventur'd to feel, such a length! such a breadth of animated ivory, perfectly well turn'd and fashion'd, the proud stiffness of which distended its skin, whose smooth polish and velvet-softness, might vie with that of the most delicate of our sex, and whose exquisite whiteness was not a little set off by a sprout of black curling hair round the root, through the jetty sprigs of which, the fair skin shew'd as, in a fine evening, you may have remark'd the clear light Ã¦ther, throught the branch-work of distant trees, over topping the summet of a hill: then the broad and bluish-casted incarnate of the head, and blue serpentines of its veins, altogether compos'd the most striking assemblage of figure and colours in nature; in short, it stood an object of terror and delight.<break time="100ms" />But what was yet more surprising, the owner of this natural curiosity (through the want of occasions in the strictness of his home-breeding, and the little time he had been in town not having afforded him one) was hitherto an absolute stranger, in practice at least, to the use of all that manhood he was so nobly stock'd with; and it now fell to my lot to stand his first trial of it, if I could resolve to run the risques of its disproportion to that tender part of me, which such an over-siz'd machine was very fit to lay in ruins.<break time="100ms" />But it was now of the latest to deliberate, for by this time, the young fellow, overheated with the present objects, and too high mettl'd to be longer curb'd in by that modesty and awe which had hitherto restrain'd him, ventur'd, under the stronger impulse and instructive promptership of nature alone, to slip his hands, trembling with eager impetuous desires, under my petty-coats, and seeing, I suppose, nothing extremely severe in my looks to stop, or dash him, he feels out and seizes gently the center-spot of his ardours: oh then! the fiery touch of his fingers determines me, and my fears melting away before the glowing intolerable heat, my thighs disclose of themselves, and yield all liberty to his hand: and now a favourable movement giving my petty-coats a toss, the avenue lay too fair, too open to be mist; he is now upon me: I had placed myself with a jet under him, as commodious, and open as possible to his attempts, which were untoward enough, for his machine meeting with no inlet, bore and batter'd stiffly against me in random pushes, now above, now below, now beside his point, till burning with impatience from its irritating touches, I guided gently with my hand, this furious fescue to where my young novice was now to be taught his first lesson of pleasure: thus-he nick'd at length the warm and insufficient orifice: but he was made to find no breach practicable, and mine, tho' so often enter'd, was still far from wide enough to take him easily in.<break time="100ms" />By my direction, however, the head of his unwieldy machine was so critically pointed, that feeling him fore-right against the tender opening, a favourable motion from me, met his timely thrust, by which the lips of it, strenuously dilated, gave way to his thus assisted impetuosity, so that we might both feel that he had gain'd a lodgement: persuing then his point, he soon, by violent, and to me most painful piercing thrusts, wedges himself at least so far in, as to be now tolerably secure of his entrance: here he stuck; and I now felt such a mixture of pleasure and pain, as there is no giving a definition of: I dreaded alike his splitting me farther up, or his with-drawing: I could not bear either to keep, or part with him: the sense of pain, however, prevailing, from his prodigious size and stiffness, acting upon me in those continu'd rapid thrusts with which he furiously persu'd his penetration, made me cry out gently: "oh, my dear, you hurt me!" This was enough to check the tender respectful boy, even in his mid-career: and he immediately drew out the sweet cause of my complaint, whilst his eyes eloquently express'd at once his grief for hurting me, and his reluctance at dislodging from quarters, of which the warmth and closeness had given him a gust of pleasure that he was now desire-mad to satisfy, and yet too much a novice not to be afraid of my withholding his relief, on account of the pain he had put me to.<break time="100ms" />But I was myself far from being pleas'd with his having too much regarded my tender exclaims, for now more and more fir'd with the object before me, as it still stood with the fiercest erection, unbonneted, and displaying its broad vermillion head: I first gave the youth a re-encouraging kiss, which he repaid me with a fervour that seem'd at once to thank me, and bribe my farther compliance, and I soon replac'd myself in a posture to receive, at all risques, the renew'd invasion, which he did not delay an instant; for being presently remounted, I once more felt the smooth hard gristle, forcing an entrance, which he achiev'd rather easier than before: pain'd, however, as I was, with his efforts of gaining a complete admission, which he was so regardful as to manage by gentle degrees, I took care not to complain; in the mean time, the soft strait passage gradually loosens, yields, and, stretch'd to its utmost bearing, by the stiff, thick, in-driven engine, sensible at once to the ravishing pleasure of the feel, and the pain of the distension, let him in about half way, when all the most nervous activity he now exerted to further his penetration, gain'd him not an inch of his purpose; for whilst he hesitated there, the crisis of pleasure overtook him, and the close compressure of the warm surrounding fold, drew from him the extatic gush, even before mine was ready to meet it, kept up by the pain I had endur'd in the course of the engagement, from the unsufferable size of his weapon, tho' it was not as yet in above half its length.
