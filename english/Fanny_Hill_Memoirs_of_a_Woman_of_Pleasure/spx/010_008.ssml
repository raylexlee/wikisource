        <break time="100ms" />But all this pleasure tending, like life from its first instants, towards its own dissolution, liv'd too fast, not to bring on upon the spur its delicious moment of mortality; for presently the approach of the tender agony discover'd itself by its usual signals, that were quickly follow'd by my dear love's liquid emanation of himself, that spun out, and shot feelingly indeed! up the ravish'd indraught, where the sweetly soothing balmy titillaton open'd at the warm jerk, all the sluices of joy on my side, which extatically in flow, help'd to allay the prurient glow, and drown'd our pleasure for awhile, soon however to be on float again! for Charles, true to nature's laws, in one breath expiring, and ejaculating, languish'd not long in the dissolving trance, but recovering spirit again, soon gave me to feel that the true mettle springs of his instrument of pleasure, were by love, and perhaps by a long vacation, wound up too high to be let down by a single explosion; his stiffness still stood my friend: resuming then the action afresh, without dislodging, or giving me the trouble of parting from my sweet tenant, we play'd over-again the same opera, with the same delightful harmony and concert: our ardours, like our love, knew no remission: and, all as the tide serv'd, my lover, lavish of his stores, and pleasure-milk'd, overflow'd me once more from the fulness of those his oval reservoirs of the genial emulsion: whilst on my side, a convulsive grasp in the instant of my giving down my liquid contribution, render'd me sweetly subservient at once, to the increase of his joy, and of its effusions, moving me so as to make me exert all those springs of the compressive exsuction, with which the sensitive mechanism of that part thirstily draws and drains the nipple of Love, with much such an instinctive eagerness, and attachment, as, to compare great with less, kind nature engages infants at the breast, by the pleasure they find in the motion of their little mouths and cheeks, to extract the milky stream prepar'd for their nourishment.<break time="100ms" />But still there was no end of his vigour: this double-discharge, had so far from extinguish'd his desires, for that time, that it had not even calm'd them: and, at his age, desires are power: he was proceeding then amazingly to push it to a third triumph, still without uncasing: if a tenderness natural to true love, had not inspir'd me with self-denial enough to spare, and not overstrain him, and accordingly, entreating him to give himself and me quarter, I obtain'd at length a short suspension of arms, but not before he had exultingly satisfy'd me that he gave out standing.<break time="100ms" />The remainder of the night, with what we borrow'd upon the day, we employ'd with unweary'd fervour, in celebrating thus the festival of our re-meeting; and got up pretty late in the morning, gay, brisk, and alert, though rest had been a stranger to us, but the pleasures of love had been to us, what the joy at victory is to an army, repose, refreshment: every thing.<break time="100ms" />The journey into the country being now intirely out of the question, and orders having been given over-night for turning the horses heads towards London, we left the inn as soon as we had breakfasted, not without a liberal distribution of the tokens of my grateful sense of the happiness I had met with in it.<break time="100ms" />Charles and I were in my coach, the captain and my companion in a chaise hir'd purposely for them, to leave us the conveniency of a tête-à-tête.<break time="100ms" />Here, on the road, as the tumult of my senses was tolerably compos'd, I had command enough of head, to break, properly, to him, the course of life that the consequences of my separation from him had driven me into, which, at the same time that he tenderly deplor'd with me, he was the less shock'd at, as on reflecting how he had left me circumstanc'd, he could not be entirely unprepar'd for it.<break time="100ms" />But when I open'd the state of my fortune to him, and with that sincerity, which from me, to him, was so much a nature in me, I begg'd of him his acceptance of it, on his own terms, I should appear to you perhaps too partial to my passion, were I to attempt the doing his delicacy justice. I shall content myself then with assuring you, that after his flatly refusing the unreserv'd, unconditional donation that I long persecuted him in vain to accept, it was at length, in obedience to his serious commands (for I stood out unaffectedly, till, he exerted the sovereign authority which love had given him over me) that I yielded my consent to wave the remonstrance I did not fail of making strongly to him, against his degrading himself, and incurring the reflexion, however unjust, of having, for respects of fortune, barter'd his honour for infamy and prostitution, in making one his wife, who thought herself too much honour'd in being but his mistress.<break time="100ms" />The plea of love then over-ruling all objections, Charles, entirely won with the merit of my sentiments for him, which he could not but read the sincerity of in a heart ever open to him, oblig'd me to receive his hand, by which means I was in pass, amongst other innumerable blessings, to bestow a legal parentage on those fine children you have seen by this happiest of matches.<break time="100ms" />Thus, at length, I got snug into port, where, in the bosom of virtue, I gather'd the only uncorrupt sweets: where, looking back on the course of vice, I had run, and comparing its infamous blandishments with the infinitely superior joys of innocence, I could not help pitying, even in point of taste, those who, immers'd in a gross sensuality, are insensible to the so delicate charms of Virtue, than which even Pleasure has not a greater friend, nor than Vice a greater enemy. Thus temperance makes men lords over those pleasures that intemperance enslaves them to: the one, parent of health, vigour, fertility, chearfulness, and every other desirable good in life, the other, of diseases, debility, barrenness, self-loathing, with only every evil incident to human nature.
