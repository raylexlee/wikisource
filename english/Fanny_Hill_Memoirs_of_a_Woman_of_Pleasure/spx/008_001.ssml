        <break time="100ms" /><break time="100ms" />The girls all this time did not in the least smoak the mystery of this new customer, but Mrs. Cole, as soon as we were conveniently alone, insur'd me, in virtue of her long experience in these matters, that for this bout my charms had not miss'd fire, for that by his eagerness, his manner, and looks, she was sure he had it; the only point now in doubt was his character, and circumstances, which her knowledge of the town would soon gain her sufficient acquaintance with, to take her measures upon.<break time="100ms" />And effectively, in a few hours, her intelligence serv'd her so well, that she learn'd that this conquest of mine was no other than Mr. Norbert, a gentleman originally of a great fortune, which, with a constitution naturally not the best, he had greatly impair'd by his over-violent pursuit of the vices of the town, in the course of which having worn out and stal'd all the more common modes of debauchery, he had fallen into a taste of maiden-hunting, in which chace he had ruin'd a number of girls, sparing no expence to compass his ends, and generally using them well till tir'd, or cool'd by enjoyment, or springing a new face, he could with more ease disembarrass himself of the old ones, and resign them up to their fate, as his sphere of atchievements of that sort lay only a mongst such as he could proceed with by way of bargain and sale.<break time="100ms" />Concluding from these premises, Mrs. Cole observ'd that a character of this sort was ever lawful prize; that the sin would be, not to make the best of our market of him; and that she thought such a girl as me only too good for him at any rate, and on any terms.<break time="100ms" />She went then, at the hour appointed to his lodgings in one of our inns of court, which were furnish'd in a taste of grandeur that had a special eye to all the conveniences of luxury and pleasure. Here she found him in ready waiting, and after finishing her business of pretence, and a long circuit of discussions concerning her trade, which she said was very bad, the qualities of her servants, prentices, journey-women, the discourse naturally landed at length on me, when Mrs. Cole acting admirably the good old prating gossip, who lets every thing escape her, when her tongue is set in motion, cook'd him up a story so plausible of me, throwing in every now and then such strokes of art, with all the simplest air of nature, in praise of my person and temper, as finish'd him finely for her purpose, whilst nothing could be better counterfeited than her innocence of his; but when now fir'd, and on edge, he proceeded to drop hints of his design and views upon me, after he had with much confusion and pains brought her to the point (she kept as long aloof from as she thought proper) of understanding him, without now affecting to pass for a dragoness of virtue, by flying out into those violent and ever suspicious passions, she stuck with a better grace and effect to the character of a plain, honest, good sort of a woman, that knew no harm, and that getting her bread in an honest way, was made of easy and flexible stuff enough to be wrought upon to his ends, by his superior skill and address; but however, she managed so artfully that three or four meetings took place, before he could obtain the least favourable hope of her assistance, without which, he had, by a number of fruitless messages, letters, and other direct trials of my disposition, convinc'd himself there was no coming at me, all which too rais'd at once my character and price with him.<break time="100ms" />Regardful, however, of not carrying these difficulties to such a length as might afford time for starting discoveries, or incidents, unfavourable to her Plan, she at last pretended to be won over by meer dint of entreaties, promises and above all, by the dazzling sum she took care to wind him up to the specification of, when it was now even a piece of art to feign, at once a yeilding to the allurements of a great interest, as a pretext for her yeilding at all, and the manner of it such, as might perswade him she had never before dipp'd her virtuous fingers in an affair of that sort.<break time="100ms" />Thus she led him through all the gradations of difficulty, and obstacles, necessary to enhance the value of the prize he aim'd at, and in conclusion, he was so struck with the little beauty I was mistress of, and so eagerly bent on gaining his ends of me, that he left her even no room to boast of her management in bringing him up to her mark, he drove so plum of himself into every thing tending to make him swallow the bait: not that in other respects, Mr. Norbert was not clear-sighted enough, not that he did not perfectly know the town, and even by experience, the very branch of imposition now in practice upon him; but we had his passion to friend so much, he was so blinded, and hurried on by it, that he would have thought any undeception a very ill office done to his pleasure. Thus concurring, even precipitantly, to the point she wanted him at, Mrs. Cole brought him at last to hug himself on the cheap bargain, he consider'd the purchase of my imaginary jewel, was to him, at no more than three hundred guineas to myself, and an hundred to the brokeress; being a slender recompence for all her pains, and all the scruples of conscience she had now sacrificed to him for this the first time of her life; which sums were to be paid down on the nail, upon livery of my person, exclusive of some no inconsiderable presents that had been made in the course of the negociation: during which, I had occasionally, but sparingly, been introduc'd into his company, at proper times and hours, in which it is incredible how little it seem'd necessary to strain my natural disposition to modesty higher, in order to pass it upon him for that of a very maid: all my looks and gestures ever breathing nothing but that innocence which the men so ardently require in us, for no other end than to feast themselves with the pleasure of destroying it, and which they are so grievously, with all their skill, subject to mistakes in.<break time="100ms" />When the articles of the treaty had been fully agreed on, the stipulated payments duly secur'd, and nothing now remain'd but the execution of the main point, which center'd in the surrender of my person up to his free disposal and use, Mrs. Cole manag'd her objections, especially to his lodgings, and insinuations so nicely, that it became his own mere motion, and urgent request, that this copy of a wedding should be finish'd at her house: at first, indeed, she did not care, not she, to have such doings in it,——she would not for a thousand pounds have any of the servants, or 'prentices know it— her precious good name would be gone for ever,-with the like excuses: however, on superior objections to all other expedients, whilst she took care to start none but those that were most liable to them, it came round at last to the necessity of her obliging him in that conveniency, and of doing a little more where she had already done so much.
