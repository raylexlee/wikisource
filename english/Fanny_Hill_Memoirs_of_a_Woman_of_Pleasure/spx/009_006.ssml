        <break time="100ms" />I had now, through more than one rent, discover'd and felt his thighs, the skin of which seem'd the smoother and fairer for the coarseness, and even dirt of his dress; as the teeth of Negroes seem the whiter for the surrounding black: and poor indeed of habit! poor of understanding! he was however abundantly rich in personal treasures, such as flesh, firm, plump, and replete with the sweet juices of youth, and robust well-knit limbs. My fingers too had now got within reach of the true, the genuine sensitive plant, which instead of shrinking from the touch, joys to meet it, and swells, and vegetates under it: mine pleasingly informing me that matters were so ripe for the discovery we meditated, that they were too mighty for the confinement they were ready to break; a waistband that I unskewer'd, and a rag of shirt that I remov'd, and which could not have cover'd a quarter of it, reveal'd the whole of the ideot's standard of distinction, erect, in full pride and display: but such an one! it was positively of so tremendous a size, that prepar'd as we were to see something extraordinary, it still, out of measure surpass'd our expectation, and astonish'd even me, who had not been us'd to trade in trifles: in fine, it might have answer'd very well the making a show of: its enormous head seem'd in hue and size, not unlike a common sheep's heart; then you might have troll'd dice securely along the broad back of the body of it: the length of it too was prodigious; then the rich appendage of the treasure-bag beneath, large in proportion, gather'd, and crisp'd up, round, in shallow furrows, help'd to fill the eye, and complete the proof of his being a natural, not quite in vain, since it was full manifest that he inherited, and largely too, the prerogative of majesty, which distinguishes that otherwise most unfortunate condition, and gives rise to the vulgar saying, "That a fool's bauble is a lady's play-fellow:" Nor wholly without reason; for, generally speaking, it is in love, as it is in war, where the longest weapon carries it. Nature, in short, had done so much to him in those parts, that she perhaps held her self acquitted for doing so little for his head.<break time="100ms" />For my part, who had sincerely no intention to push the joke further than simply satisfying my curiosity with the sight of it alone, I was content in spite of the temptation that star'd me in the face, with having rais'd a may-pole for another to hang a garland; for by this time, easily reading Louisa's desires in her wishful eyes, I acted the commodious part, and made her, who sought no better sport, significant signs of encouragement to go through-stitch with the adventure: intimating too that I would stay and see fair play; in which indeed I had in view to humour a new-born curiosity, to observe what appearances active nature would put on in a natural, in the course of this her darling operation.<break time="100ms" />Louisa, whose appetite was up, and who, like the industrious bee, was, it seems, not above gathering the sweets of so rare a flower, tho' she found it planted on a dung hill, was but too readily dispos'd to take the benefit of my cession: urg'd then strongly by her own desires, and emboldened by me, she presently determin'd to risque a trial of parts with the ideot, who was by this time nobly inflam'd for her purpose, by all the irritations we had us'd to put the principles of pleasure effectually into motion, and to wind up the springs of its organ to their supreme pitch: and it stood accordingly stiff and straining, ready to burst with the blood and spirits that swell'd it to a bulk! No! I shall never forget it.<break time="100ms" />Louisa then taking and holding the fine handle that so invitingly offer'd itself, led the ductile youth by that master-tool of his, as she stept backward towards the bed, which he joyfully gave way to, under the incitations of instinct, and palpably deliver'd up to the goad of desire.<break time="100ms" />Stopt then by the bed, she took the fall she lov'd, and lean'd to the most, gently backward upon it, still holding fast what she held, and taking care to give her cloaths a convenient toss up, so that her thighs duly disclos'd, and elevated, laid open all the outward prospect of the treasury of love: the rose-lipt ouverture presenting the cock-pit so fair, that it was not in nature even for a natural to miss it: nor did he, for Louisa, fully bent on grappling with it, and impatient of dalliance or delay, directed faithfully the point of the battering piece, and bounded up with a rage of so voracious appetite, to meet, and favour the thrust of insertion, that the fierce activity on both sides, effected it, but effected it with such a pain of distention, that Louisa cry'd out violently, that she was hurt beyond all bearing, that she was kill'd: but it was too late; the storm was up, and force was on her to give way to it: For now the man machine, strongly work'd upon by the sensual passion, felt so manfully his advantages, and superiority, felt withal the sting of pleasure so intolerable, that maddening with it, his joys began to assume a character of furiousness which made me tremble for the too tender Louisa: he seem'd at this juncture greater than himself; his countenance, before so void of meaning, or expression, now grew big with the importance of the act he was upon. In short, it was not now that he was to be play'd the fool with: but what is pleasant enough, I myself was aw'd into a sort of respect for him, by the comely terrors his emotions drest him in: his eyes shooting sparks of fire, his face glowing with ardours that gave all another life to it: his teeth churning; his whole frame agitated with a raging ungovernable impetuosity, all sensibly betraying the formidable fierceness with which the genial instinct acted upon him: butting then, and goring all before him, and mad, and wild, like an overdriven steer, he ploughs up the tender furrow, all insensible of Louisa's complaints: nothing can stop, nothing can keep out a fury like his; which having once got its head in, its blind rage soon made way for the rest, piercing, rending, and breaking open all obstruction: The torn, split, wounded girl cries, struggles, invokes me to her rescue, and endeavours to get from under the young savage, or shake him off, but alass, in vain! her breath might as soon have still'd, or stemm'd a storm in winter, as all her strength have quell'd his rough assault, or put him out of his course: And indeed all her efforts, and struggles were manag'd in such disorder, that they serv'd rather to entangle, and fold her the faster in the twine of his boisterous arms; so that she was tied to the stake, and oblig'd to fight the match out, if she died for it: for his part, instinct-ridden as he was, the expressions of his animal passion partaking something of ferocity, were rather worryings than kisses, intermix'd with eager ravenous love-bites on her cheeks and neck; the prints of which did not wear out for some days after.
