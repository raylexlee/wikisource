        <break time="100ms" />When I came home again, and told Mrs. Cole this adventure, she very sensibly observ'd to me, that there was no doubt of due vengeance one time or other overtaking these miscreants, however they might escape for the present; and that, had I been the temporal instrument of it, I should have been, at least, put to a great deal more trouble and confusion than I imagine: that as to the thing itself, the less said of it was the better; but that though she might be suspected of partiality, from its being the common cause of woman-kind, out of whose mouths this practice tended to take something more precious than bread, yet she protested against any mixture of passion, with a declaration extorted from her by pure regard to truth, which was, "that whatever effect this infamous passion had in other ages, and other countries, it seem'd a peculiar blessing on our air and climate, that there was a plague-spot visibly imprinted on all that are tainted with it, in this nation at least; for that among numbers of that stamp whom she had known, or at least were universally under the scandalous suspicion of it, she could not name an exception hardly of one of them, whose character was not in all other respects the most worthless and despicable that could be, stript of all the manly virtues of their own sex, and fill'd up with only the very worst vices and follies of ours: that, in fine, they were scarce less execrable than ridiculous in their monstrous inconsistency, of loathing and contemning women, and all at the same time, apeing their manners, airs, lisp, skuttle, and, in general, all their little modes of affectation, which become them at least better, than they do these unsex'd male-misses."<break time="100ms" />But here washing my hands of them, I replunge into the stream of my history, into which I may very properly ingraft a terrible sally of Louisa's, since I had some share in it myself, and have besides engag'd myself to relate it, in point of countenance to poor Emily. It will add too one more example to thousands, in confirmation of the maxim, that when women get once out of compass, there are no lengths of licentiousness they are not capable of running.<break time="100ms" />One morning then, that both Mrs. Cole and Emily, were gone out for the day, and only Louisa and I (not to mention the house-maid) were left in charge of the house; whilst we were loitering away the time, in looking through the shop-windows, the son of a poor woman who earned very hard bread indeed by mending of stockings, in a stall in the neighbourhood, offers us some nosegays rang'd round a small basket; by selling of which the poor boy eked out his mother's maintenance of them both: nor was he fit for any other way of livelihood, since he was not only a perfect changeling, or idiot, but stammer'd so that there was no understanding even those sounds that his half-a-dozen, at most, animal ideas prompted him to utter.<break time="100ms" />The boys, and servants in the neighbourhood, had given him the nick-name of Good-natur'd Dick, from the soft simpleton's doing every thing he was bid to do at the first word, and from his naturally having no turn to mischief; then, by the way, he was perfectly well made, stout, and clean-climb'd, tall of his age, as strong as a horse, and, with all, pretty featur'd; so that he was not absolutely such a figure to be snuffed at neither, if your nicety could, in favour of such essentials, have dispens'd with a face unwash'd, hair tangl'd for want of combing, and so ragged a plight, that he might have disputed points of shew, with e'er a heathen philosopher of them all.<break time="100ms" />This boy we had often seen, and bought his flowers, out of pure compassion, and nothing more: but just at this time, as he stood presenting us his basket, a sudden whim, a start of wayward fancy seiz'd Louisa, and without consulting me, she calls him in, and began to examine his nosegays culls out two, one for herself, another for me, and pulling out half-a-crown, very currently gives it him to change, as if she had really expected he could have chang'd it: but the boy scraching his head, made his signs explain his inability, in place of words, that he could not with all his struggling, articulate.<break time="100ms" />Louisa at this, says: "Well, my lad, come upstairs with me, and I will give you your due." Winking at the same time to me, and beckoning me to accompany her, which I did, securing first the street-door, that by this means, together with the shop, became wholly the care of the faithful house-maid.<break time="100ms" />As we went up, Louisa whisper'd me, that she had conceiv'd a strange longing to be satisfy'd, whether the general rule held good with regard to this changeling and how far nature had made him amends in her best bodily gifts, for her denial of the sublimer intellectual ones; begging at the same time my assistance in procuring her this satifsfaction: a want of complaisance was never my vice, and I was so far from opposing this extravagant frolic that now, bit with the same maggot, and my curiosity conspiring with hers, I enter'd plum into it, on my own account.<break time="100ms" />Consequently, as soon as we came into Louisa's bed-chamber, whilst she was amusing him with picking out his nosegays, I undertook the lead, and began the attack: as it was not then very material to keep much measures with a mere natural, I made presently very free with him, though at my first motion of meddling, his surpise and confusion made him receive my advances but aukwardly; nay, insomuch that he bashfully shy'd, and shy'd back a little, till encouraging him with my eyes, plucking him playfully by the hair, sleeking his cheeks, and forwarding my point by a number of little wantonness, I soon turn'd him familiar, and gave nature her sweetest alarm; so that arrouz'd, and beginning to feel himself, we could, amidst all the innocent laugh and grin I had provok'd him into, perceive the fire lighting in his eyes, and diffusing over his cheeks, blend its glow with that of his blushes; the emotion in short of animal pleasure glar'd distinctly in the simpleton's countenance; yet struck with the novelty of the scene, he did not know which way to look or move; but tame, passive, simpering, with his mouth half open, in stupid rapture, stood, and tractably suffer'd me to do what I pleas'd with him: his basket was dropt out of his hands, which Louisa took care off.
