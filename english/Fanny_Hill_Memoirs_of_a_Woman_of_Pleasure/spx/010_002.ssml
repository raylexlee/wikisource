        <break time="100ms" />There setting her on his knee, and gliding one hand over the surface of that smooth polish'd, snow-white skin of hers, which now doubly shone with a dew-bright lustre, and presented to the touch something like what one would imagine of animated ivory, especially in those ruby-nippled globes, which the touch is so fond of, and delights to make love to; with the other, he was lusciously exploring the sweet secret of nature, in order to make room for a stately piece of machinery, that stood up-rear'd, between her thighs, as she continued sitting on his lap, and press'd hard for instant admission, which the tender Emily, in a fit of humour deliciously protracted, affecting to decline, and elude the very pleasure she sigh'd for, but in a style of waywardness so prettily put on, and managed, as to render it only ten times more poignant: then her eyes, all amidst the softest, dying languishment, express'd at once a mock-denial, and extreme desire, whilst her sweetness was zested with a coyness so pleasingly provoking, her moods of keeping him off, were so attractive, that they redoubl'd the impetuous rage with which he cover'd her with kisses, and kisses that whilst she seem'd to shy from or scuffle for, the cunning wanton contriv'd such sly returns of, as were doubtless the sweeter for the gust she gave them, of being stoln, or ravished.<break time="100ms" />Thus Emily, who knew no art but that which nature itself, in favour of her principal end, pleasure, had inspir'd her with; the art of yielding, coy'd it indeed, but coyed it to the purpose; for with all her straining, her wrestling, and striving to break from the clasp of his arms, she was so far wiser yet, than to mean it, that, in her struggles, it was visible, that she aim'd at nothing more than multiplying points of touch with him, and drawing yet closer the folds that held them every where entwin'd, like two tendrils of a vine intercurling together, so that the same effect, as when Louisa strove in good earnest to disengage from the ideot, was now produc'd by different motives.<break time="100ms" />Mean while, their emersion out of the cold water, had caused a general glow, a tender suffusion of heighten'd carnation over their bodies; both equally white, and smooth-skinn'd; so that as their limbs were thus amorously interwoven, in sweet confusion, it was scarce possible to distinguish who they respectively belonged to, but for the brawnier, bolder muscles of the stronger sex.<break time="100ms" />In a little time however, the champion was fairly in with her, and had tied at all points the true lover's knot, when now, adieu all the little refinements of a finessed reluctance! adieu the tender friendly feint! she was presently driven forcibly out of the power of using any art: and indeed, what art but must give way, when nature corresponding with her sweet assailant, invaded in the heart of her capital, and carried by storm, lay at the mercy of the proud conqueror, who had made his entry triumphantly, and completely? soon however to become a tributary! for the engagement growing hotter and hotter, at close quarters, she presently brought him to the pass of paying down the dear debt to nature, which she had no sooner collected in, but, like a duellist who has laid his antagonist at his feet, when he has himself received a mortal wound, Emily had scarce time to plume herself upon her victory, but shot with the same discharge, she, in a loud expiring sigh, in the closure of her eyes, the stretch-out of her limbs, and a remission of her whole frame, gave manifest signs that all was as it should be, and happily well over with her.<break time="100ms" />For my part, who had not with the calmest patience stood in the water all this time, to view this warm action, I lean'd tenderly on my gallant, and, at the close of it, seem'd to ask him with my eyes, what he thought of it; but he more eager to satisfy me by his actions, than by words, or looks, as we shoal'd the water together towards the shore, shew'd me the staff of love so intensely set up, that had not even, charity beginning at home, in this case, urged me to our mutual relief, it would have been cruel indeed to have suffer'd the youth to burst with straining, when the remedy was so obvious, and so near at hand.<break time="100ms" />Accordingly we took to a bench, whilst Emily and her spark, who belonged it seems to the sea, stood at the side-board, drinking to our good voyage, for as the last observ'd, we were well under weigh, with a fair wind up channel, and full freighted: nor indeed were we long before we finished our trip to Cythera, and unloaded in the old haven; but as the circumstances did not admit of much variation, I shall spare you the description. At the same time, allow me to place you here an excuse I am conscious of owing you, for having perhaps too much affected the figurative style; though surely it can pass no where more allowably than in a subject which is so properly the province of poetry, nay! is poetry itself, pregnant with every flower of imagination, and loving metaphors, even were not the natural expressions; for respects of fashion and sound necessarily forbid it.<break time="100ms" />Resuming now my history, you may please to know, that what with a competent number of repetitions, all in the same strain, (and by the bye, we have a certain natural sense that those repetitions are very much to the taste of) what with a circle of pleasures delicately varied, there was not a moment lost to joy all the time we staid there, till late in the night, we were re-escorted home by our 'squires, who deliver'd us safe to Mrs. Cole, with generous thanks for our company.<break time="100ms" />This too was Emily's last adventure in our way; for scarce a week after, she was, by an accident too trivial to detail to you the particulars, found out by her parents, who were in very good circumstances, and who had been punish'd for their partiality to their son, in the loss of him, occasion'd by a circumstance of their over-indulgence to his appetite: upon which, the so long engross'd stream of fondness, running violently in favour of this lost, and inhumanly abandon'd child, whom, if they had not neglected all enquiry about, they might long before have recover'd, they were now so overjoy'd at their retrieval of her, that, I presume, it made them much the less strict in examining to the bottom of things; for they seem'd very glad to take for granted, in the lump, every thing that the grave and decent Mrs. Cole was pleas'd to pass upon them; and soon afterwards sent her, from the country, a handsome acknowledgment.
