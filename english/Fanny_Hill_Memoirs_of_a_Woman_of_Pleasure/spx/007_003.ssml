        <break time="100ms" />Her truly enamour'd gallant, who had stood absorb'd and engross'd by the pleasure of the sight, long enough to afford us time to feast ours, no fear of glutting! addressed himself at length to the materials of enjoyment, and lifting the linnen veil that hung between us and his master-member of the revels, exhibited one whose eminent size proclaim'd the Owner a true woman's hero. He was besides, in every other respect, an accomplish'd gentleman, and in the bloom and vigour of youth: standing then between Harriet's legs, which were supported by her two companions at their widest extension, with one hand he gently disclos'd the lips of that luscious mouth of nature, whilst with the other, he stoop'd his mighty machine to its lure, from the heighth of its stiff stand-up towards his belly; the lips kept open by his fingers, receiv'd its broad shelving head of coral hue; and when he had nestled it in, he hover'd there a little, and the girls then deliver'd over to his hips the agreeable office of supporting her thighs: and now, as if he meant to spin out his pleasure, and give it the more play for its life, he pass'd up his instrument so slow, that we lost sight of it inch by inch, till at length it was wholly taken into the soft labaratory of love, and the mossy mounts of each fairly met together. In the mean time, we could plainly mark the prodigious effect the progressions of this delightful energy wrought in this delicious girl, gradually heightening her beauty as they heighten'd her pleasure. Her countenance, and whole frame, grew more animated; the faint blush of her cheeks gaining ground on the white, deepen'd into a florid vivid vermilion glow: her<break time="100ms" />naturally brilliant eyes now sparkled with tenfold lustre: her languor was vanish'd, and she appear'd quick spirited, and alive all over. He had now fix'd, nail'd, this tender creature with his home driven wedge, so that she lay passive per force, and unable to stir, till beginning to play, a strain of arms against this vein of delicacy, as he urg'd the to-and-fro confriction; he awaken'd, rouz'd, and touch'd her so to the heart, that, unable to contain herself, she could not but reply to his motions, as briskly as her nicety of frame would admit off, till the raging stings of the pleasure, rising towards the point, made her wild with the intolerable sensations of it, and she now threw her legs and arms about at random, as she lay lost in the sweet transport: which on his side again declar'd itself by quicker, eagerer thrusts, convulsive grasps, burning sighs, swift laborious breathings, eyes darting humid fires; all faithful tokens of the imminent approaches of the last gasp of joy: it came on at length: the baronet led the extasy, which she critically join'd in, as she felt the melting symptoms from him, in the nick of which, glewing more ardently than ever his lips to hers, with eyes lifted up in a trance, he shew'd all the signs of that agony of bliss being strong upon him, in which he sent his soul distil'd in liquid sweets, up the body of that charming creature, and gave her the finishing titillation; inly thril'd with which, we saw plainly, that she answer'd it down with all the effusion of spirit and matter she was mistress of, whilst a general soft shudder ran through all her limbs, which she gave a stretch-out of, and lay motionless, breathless, dying with dear delight; and in the heigth of its expression, showing through the nearly clos'd lids of her eyes, just the edges of their black, the rest being roll'd strongly upwards in her extasy: then her sweet mouth appear'd languishingly open, with the tip of her tongue leaning negligently towards the lower range of her white teeth, whilst the natural ruby-colour of her lips glow'd with heighten'd life; was this a subject not to dwell upon? and accordingly her lover still kept on her, with an abiding delectation, till compress'd, squeez'd, and distill'd to the last drop, he slipp'd out at last, and took leave with one fervent kiss, expressing satisfy'd desires, but unextinguish'd love.<break time="100ms" />As soon as he was off, I ran to her, and sitting down on the couch by her, rais'd her head, which she declin'd gently, and hung in my bosom, to hide her blushes and confusion at what had past, till by degrees she recompos'd herself, and accepted of a restorative glass of wine from my spark, who had left me to fetch it her, whilst her own was re-adjusting his affairs, and buttoning up, after which he led her, leaning languishingly upon him, to our stand of view round the couch.<break time="100ms" />And now Emily's partner had taken her out for her share in the dance, when this transcendently fair and sweet-tempered creature readily stood up; and if a complexion to put the rose and lilly out of countenance, extreme pretty features, and that florid health and bloom for which the country-girls are so lovely, might pass her for a beauty, she certainly was one, and one of the most striking of the fair ones.
