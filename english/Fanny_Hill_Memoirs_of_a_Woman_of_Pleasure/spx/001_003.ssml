        <break time="100ms" />It was kept by an elderly woman, who sat at the receipt of custom, with a book before her in great form and order, and several scrolls, ready made out, of directions for places.<break time="100ms" />I made up then to this important personage, without lifting up my eyes, or observing any of the people round me, who were attending there on the same errand as myself, and dropping her curtsies nine-deep, just made a shift to stammer out my business to her.<break time="100ms" />Madam having heard me out, with all the gravity and brow of a petty-minister of State, and seeing at one glance over my figure, what I was, made me no answer, but to ask me the preliminary shilling, on receipt of which she told me, places for women were exceedingly scarce, especially as I seemed too slight-built for hard-work; but that she would look over her book, and see what was to be done for me, desiring me to stay a little till she had dispatched some other customers.<break time="100ms" />On this, I drew back a little, most heartily mortified at a declaration which carried with it a killing uncertainty, that my circumstances could not well endure.<break time="100ms" />Presently, assuming more courage, and seeking some diversion from my uneasy thoughts, I ventured to lift up my head a little, and sent my eyes on a course round the room, wherein they met full tilt with those of a lady (for such my extreme innocence pronounc'd her) sitting in a corner of the room, dress'd in a velvet mantle (nota bene, in the midst of summer), with her bonnet off; squob-fat, red-faced, and at least fifty.<break time="100ms" />She look'd as if she would devour me with her eyes, staring at me from head to foot, without the least regard to the confusion and blushes her eying me so fixedly put me to, and which were to her, no doubt, the strongest recommendation, and marks of my being fit for her purpose. After a little time, in which my air, person and whole figure had undergone a strict examination, which I had, on my part, tried to render favourable to me, by primming, drawing up my neck, and setting my best looks, she advanc'd and spoke to me with the greatest demureness:<break time="100ms" />Qu. Sweet-heart, do you want a place?<break time="100ms" />Ans. Yes, and please you, (with a curtsy down to the ground).<break time="100ms" />Upon this, she acquainted me, that she was actually come to the office herself to look out for a servant——that she believed I might do, with a little of her instructions,——that she could take my very looks for a sufficient character,——that London was a very wicked, vile place,——that she hop'd I would be tractable, and keep out of bad company,——in short, she said all to me that an old experienced practitioner in town could think of, and which was much more than was necessary to take in an artless inexperienced country-maid, who was even afraid of becoming a wanderer about the streets, and therefore gladly jump'd at the first offer of a shelter, especially from so grave and matron-like a lady, for such my flattering fancy assur'd me this now mistress of mine was: I being actually hired under the nose of the good woman that kept the office, whose shrewd smiles and shrugs I could not help observing, and innocently interpreted them as marks of her being pleased at my getting into place so soon: but, as I afterwards came to know, these Beldams understood one another very well, and this was a market where Mrs. Brown, my mistress, frequently attended, on the watch for any fresh goods that might offer there, for the use of her customers, and her own profit.<break time="100ms" />Madam was, however, so well pleased with her bargain, that, fearing, I presume, lest better advice, or some accident might occasion my slipping through her fingers, she would officiously take me in a coach to my inn, where calling herself for my box, it was, I being present, delivered without the least scruple, or explanation as to where I was going.<break time="100ms" />This being over, she bid the coachman drive to a shop in St. Paul's Churchyard, where she bought a pair of gloves, which she gave me, and thence renewed her directions to the coachman, to drive to her house in —— street, who accordingly landed us at her door, after I had been chear'd up, and entertain'd by the way with the most plausible flams, without one syllable from which I could conclude anything but that I was by the greatest good luck fallen into the hands of the kindest mistress, not to say friend, that the varsal world could afford; and accordingly I enter'd her doors with most complete confidence and exultation, promising myself, that, as soon as I should be a little settled, I would acquaint Esther Davis with my rare good fortune.<break time="100ms" />You may be sure the good opinion of my place was not lessened by the appearance of a very handsome back-parlour, into which I was led, and which seemed to me magnificently furnished, who had never seen better rooms than the ordinary ones in inns upon the road. There were two gilt pier-glasses, and a buffet, on which a few pieces of plate, set out to the most shew, dazzled, and altogether persuaded me, that I must be got into a very reputable family.<break time="100ms" />Here my mistress first began her part, with telling me, that I must have good spirits, and learn to be free with her; that she had not taken me to be a common servant, to do domestic drudgery, but to be a kind of companion to her; and that, if I would be a good girl, she would do more than twenty mothers for me; to all which I answered only by the profoundest and the awkwardest curtsies, and a few monosyllables, such as yes! no! to be sure.<break time="100ms" />Presently my mistress touch'd the bell, and in came a strapping maid-servant, who had let us in: Here, Martha, said Mrs. Brown, I have just hir'd this young woman to look after my linnen; so step up, and shew her her chamber; and I charge you to use her with as much respect as you would myself, for I have taken a prodigious liking to her, and I do not know what I shall do for her.<break time="100ms" />Martha, who was an arch jade, and being used to this decoy, had her cue perfect, made me a kind of half curtsy, and asked me to walk up with her, and accordingly shew'd me a neat room two pair of stairs backwards, in which there was a handsome bed, where Martha told me I was to lay with a young gentlewoman, a cousin of my mistress's, who she was sure would be vastly good to me: then she ran out into such affected encomiums on her good mistress! her sweet mistress! and how happy I was to light upon her,——that I could not have bespoke a better,——with other the like gross stuff, such as would itself have started suspicions in any but such an unpractised simpleton, who was perfectly new to life, and who took every word she said, in the very sense she laid out for me to take it; but she readily saw what a penetration she had to deal with, and measured me very rightly in her manner of whistling to me, so as to make me pleased with my cage, and blind to the wires.
