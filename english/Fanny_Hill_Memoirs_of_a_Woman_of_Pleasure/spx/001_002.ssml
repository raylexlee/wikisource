        <break time="100ms" />The idea however of having the company of a townswoman with her, was the trivial, and all the motive that engaged Esther to take charge of me during my journey to town, where she told me, after her manner and style: "as how several maids out of the country had made themselves and all their kin for ever, that by preserving Vartue, some had taken so with their masters, that they had married them, and kept them coaches, and lived vastly grand, and happy, and some, may-hap came to be Dutchesses: Luck was all, and why not I as well as another," with other almanacs to this purpose, which set me a tiptoe to begin this promising journey, and to leave a place, which though my native one, contained no relations that I had reason to regret, and was grown insupportable to me, from the change of the tenderest usage into a cold air of charity, with which I was entertain'd, even at the only friend's house, that I had the least expectations of care and protection from: She was how ever so just to me, as to manage the turning into money the little matters that remained to me after the debts, and burial charges were accounted for, and at my departure put my whole fortune into my hands, which consisted of a very slender wardrobe, pack'd up in a very portable box, and eight guineas, with seventeen shillings in silver, stowed in a spring-pouch, which was a greater treasure than ever I had yet seen together, and which l could not conceive there was a possibility of running out: and indeed I was so entirely taken up with the joy of seeing myself mistress of such an immense sum, that I gave very litle attention to a world of good advice which was given me with it.<break time="100ms" />Places then being taken for Esther and me, in the Chester-Waggon, I pass over a very immaterial scene of leave-taking, at which I dropt a few tears betwixt grief and joy; and for the same reasons of insignificance, skip over all that happened to me on the road, such as the Waggoner's looking liquorish on me, the schemes laid for me by some of the passengers, which were defeated by the vigilance of my guardian Esther, who, to do her justice, took a motherly care of me, at the same time that she taxed me for her protection, by making me bear all travelling charges, which I defray'd with the utmost chearfulness, and thought myself much obliged to her into the bargain. She took indeed great care that we were not over-rated, or imposed on, as well as of managing as frugally as possible; expensiveness was not her vice.<break time="100ms" />It was pretty late in a summer evening when we reached the town, in our slow conveyance, though drawn by six at length. As we passed thro' the greatest streets that led to our inn, the noise of the coaches, the hurry, the crowds of foot passengers, in short, the new scenery of the shops and houses at once pleased and amazed me.<break time="100ms" />But guess at my mortification and surprize when we came to the inn, and our things were landed and deliver'd to us, when my fellow traveller and protectress, Esther Davis, who had used me with the utmost tenderness during the journey, and prepared me by no preceding signs for the stunning blow I was to receive; when, I say, my only dependence, and friend, in this strange place, all of a sudden assumed a strange and cool air towards me, as if she dreaded my becoming a burden to her.<break time="100ms" />Instead, then, of proffering me the continuance of her assistance and good offices, which I relied upon, and never more wanted, she thought herself, it seems, abundantly acquitted of her engagements to me, by having brought me safe to my journey's end, and seeing nothing in her procedure towards me, but what was natural and in order, began to embrace me by way of taking leave, whilst I was so confounded, so struck, that I had not spirit or sense enough so much as to mention my hopes or expectations from her experience, and knowledge of the place she had brought me to.<break time="100ms" />Whilst I stood thus stupid and mute, which she doubtless attributed to nothing more than a concern at parting, this idea procured me perhaps a slight alleviation of it, in the following harangue: "That now we were got safe to London, and that she was obliged to go to her place, she advised me by all means to get into one as soon as possible——that I need not fear getting one——there were more places than parish-churches——that she advised me to go to an intelligence office——that if she heard of any thing stirring, she would find me out and let me know——that in the meantime, I should take a private lodging, and acquaint her where to send to me——that she wish'd me good luck,——and hoped I should always have the grace to keep myself honest, and not bring a disgrace on my parentage:" with this, she took her leave of me, and left me, as it were, on my own hands, full as lightly as I had been put into hers.<break time="100ms" />Left thus alone, absolutely destitute and friendless, I began then to feel most bitterly the severity of this separation, the scene of which had passed in a little room in the inn; and no sooner was her back turned, but the affliction I felt at my helpless strange circumstances, burst out into a flood of tears, which infinitely relieved the oppression of my heart; though I still remained stupefied, and most perfectly perplex'd how to dispose of myself.<break time="100ms" />One of the waiters coming in, added yet more to my uncertainty, by asking me, in a short way, if I called for anything? to which I replied, innocently: No.; but I wished him to tell me where I might get a lodging for that night: he said he would go and speak to his mistress, who accordingly came, and told me drily, without entering in the least into the distress she saw me in, that I might have a bed for a shilling: and that, as she supposed I had some friends in town (here I fetched a deep sigh in vain!) I might provide for myself in the morning.<break time="100ms" />'Tis incredible what trifling consolations the human mind will seize in its greatest afflictions. The assurance of nothing more than a bed to lie on that night, calmed my agonies; and being asham'd to acquaint the mistress of the inn that I had no friends to apply to in town, I proposed to myself to proceed, the very next morning, to an intelligence-office, to which I was furnish'd with written directions, on the back of a ballad of Esther's giving me. There I counted on getting information of any place that such a country-girl as I might be fit for, and where I could get into any sort of being, before my little stock should be consumed; and as to a character, Esther had often repeated to me, that I might depend on her managing me one; nor, however affected I was at her leaving me thus, did I entirely cease to rely on her, as I began to think, good-naturedly, that her procedure was all in course, and that it was only my ignorance of life that had made me take it in the light I at first did.<break time="100ms" />Accordingly, the next morning I dress'd me as clean and as neat as my rustic wardrobe would permit me; and having left my box, with special recommendation, to the landlady, I ventured out by myself, and without any more difficulty than can be supposed of a young country-girl, barely fifteen, and to whom every sign or shop was a gazing trap, I got to the wish'd-for intelligence-office.
