        <break time="100ms" />But it was not so easy to replace to our community the loss of so sweet a member of it, for, not to mention her beauty, she was one of those mild, pliant characters, that if one does not entirely esteem, one can scarce help loving, which is not such a bad compensation neither: owing all her weaknesses to good-nature; and an indolent facility that kept her too much at the mercy of first impressions, she had just sense enough to know that she wanted leading-strings, and thought herself so much obliged to any who would take the pains to think for her, and guide her, that with a very little management, she was capable of being made a most agreeable, nay, a most virtuous wife; for vice, it is probable, had never been her choice, or her fate, if it had not been for occasion, or example, or had she not depended less upon herself, than upon her circumstances: this presumption her conduct afterwards verified; for presently meeting with a match, that was ready cut and dry for her, with a neighbour's son of her own rank, and a young man of sense and order, who took her as the widow of one lost at sea, (for so it seems one of her gallants, whose name she had made free with, really was) she naturally struck into all the duties of her domestic, with as much simplicity of affection, with as much constancy and regularity, as if she had never swerv'd from a state of undebauch'd innocence from her youth.<break time="100ms" />These desertions had, however, now so far thinn'd Mrs. Cole's cluck, that she was left with only me, like a hen with one chicken; but tho' she was earnestly entreated and encourag'd to recruit her corps, her growing infirmities, and above all the tortures of a stubborn hip-gout, which she found would yield to no remedy, determin'd her to break up her business, and retire with a decent pittance into the country, where I promised myself, nothing so sure, as my going down to live with her, as soon as I had seen a little more of life, and improv'd my small matters into a competency that would create me an independence on the world; for I was now, thanks to Mrs. Cole, wise enough to keep that essential in view.<break time="100ms" />Thus I was then to lose my faithful preceptress, as did the Philosophers of the Town the White Crow of her profession; for, besides that, she never ransomed her customers, whose taste too she ever studiously consulted; besides that she never racked her pupils with unconscionable extortions, nor ever put their hand earnings, as she call'd them, under the contribution of poundage; she was a severe enemy to the seduction of innocence, and confin'd her acquisitions solely to those unfortunate young women, who, having lost it, were but the juster objects of compassion: amongst these indeed, she pick'd out such as suited her views, and taking them under her protection, rescu'd them from the danger of the public sinks of ruin and misery, to place or form them, well, or ill, in the manner you have seen. Having then settled her affairs, she set out on her journey, after taking the most tender leave of me, and, at the end of some excellent instructions, recommending me to myself, with an anxiety, perfectly maternal: in short, she affected me so much that I was not presently reconcil'd to myself for suffering her, at any rate, to go without me; but fate had it seems, otherwise dispos'd of me.<break time="100ms" />I had, on my separation from Mrs. Cole, taken a pleasant convenient house near Marybone, but easy to rent and manage, from its smallness, which I furnish'd neatly and modestly: there, with a reserve of eight hundred pounds, the fruit of my deference to Mrs. Cole's counsels, exclusive of cloaths, some jewels, some plate, I saw myself in purse for a long time, to wait without impatience for what the chapter of accidents might produce in my favour.<break time="100ms" />Here, under the new character of a young gentlewoman, whose husband was gone to sea, I had mark'd me out such lines of life and conduct, as leaving me at a competent liberty to pursue my views, either of pleasure or fortune, bounded me nevertheless strictly within the rules of decency, and discretion: a disposition in which you cannot escape observing a true pupil of Mrs. Cole's.<break time="100ms" />I was scarce however well warm in my new abode, when going out one morning pretty early to enjoy the freshness of it, in the pleasing outlet of the fields, accompanied only by a maid, whom I had newly hired; as we were carelessly walking among the trees, we were alarm'd with the noise of a violent coughing, turning our heads towards which, we distinguish'd a plain well-dress'd elderly gentleman, who, attack'd with a sudden fit, was so much overcome as to be forc'd to give way to it, and sit down at the foot of a tree, where he seem'd suffocating with the severity of it, being perfectly black in the face: not less mov'd than frighten'd with which I flew on the instant to his relief, and using the rote of practice I had observ'd on the like occasion, I loosen'd his cravat, and clapp'd him on the back; but whether to any purpose, or whether the cough had had its course, I know not; but the fit went immediately off; and now recover'd to his speech, and legs, he returned me thanks, with as much emphasis as if I had sav'd his life: this naturally engaging a conversation, he acquainted me where he lived, which was, at a considerable distance from where I met with him, and where he had stray'd insensibly on the same intention of a morning-walk.<break time="100ms" />He was, as I afterwards learn'd, in the course of the intimacy, which this little accident gave birth to, an old batchelor turn'd of sixty, but of a fresh, vigorous complexion, insomuch that he scarce mark'd five and forty, having never rack'd, or forc'd his constitution, by permitting his desires to over tax his ability.<break time="100ms" />As to his birth, and condition; his parents, honest and fail'd mechanicks, had by the best traces he could get of them, left him an infant orphan on the parish; so that it was from a charity school, that by honesty and industry he made his way into a merchant's compting-house, from whence being sent to a house in Cadiz, he there, by his talents and activity, acquired a fortune, but an immense one; with which he return'd to his native country, where he could not, however, so much as fish one single relation out of the obscurity he was born in. Taking then a taste for retirement, and pleasd to enjoy life, like a mistress, in the dark, he flow'd his days in all the ease of opulence, without the least parade of it, and rather studying the concealment, than the show of a fortune, looking down on a world he perfectly knew; himself, to his wish, unknown, and unmark'd by it.<break time="100ms" />But as I propose to devote a letter entirely to the pleasure of retracing to you all the particulars of my acquaintance with this ever, to me, memorable friend, I shall, in this, transiently touch on no more than may serve, as mortar, to cement, or form the connexion of my history, and to obviate your surprise that one of my high blood, and relish of life, should count a gallant of threescore such a catch.
