        <break time="100ms" />There were still the same exquisite lineaments, still the same vivid vermilion, and bloom reigning in his face, but now the roses were more fully blown: the tant of his travels, and a beard somewhat more distinguishable, had, at the expence of no more delicacy than what he could better spare, than not, given it an air of becoming manliness, and maturity, that symmetriz'd nobly with that air of distinction and empire, with which nature had stamp'd it, in a rare mixture with the sweetness of it; still nothing had he lost of that smooth plumpness of flesh, which glowing with freshness, blooms florid to the eye, and delicious to the touch: then, his shoulders were grown more square, his shape more form'd, more portly, but still free, and airy. In short, his figure show'd riper, greater, and perfecter to the experienced eye, than in his tender youth; and now, he was not much more than two and twenty. In this interval, however, I pick'd out of the broken, often pleasingly, interrupted account of himself, that he was, at that instant, actually on his road to London, in not a very paramount plight, or condition, having been wreck'd on the Irish coast, for which he had prematurely embark'd, and lost the little all he had brought with him from the South-Seas, so that he had not, till after great shifts and hardships, in the company of his fellow traveller, the captain, got so far on his journey; that so it was, (having heard of his father's death and circumstances,) he had now the world to begin again, on a new account: a situation, which he assur'd me, in a vein of sincerity, that flowing from his heart, penetrated mine, gave him no farther pain, than that he had it not in his power, to make me as happy as he could wish. My fortune, you will please to observe, I had not enter'd upon any overture of, reserving to feast myself with the surprize of it to him, in calmer instants. And as to my dress, it could give him no idea of the truth, not only as it was mourning, but likewise in a stile of plainness and simplicity, that I have ever kept to with studied art. He press'd me indeed tenderly to satisfy his ardent curiosity, both with regard to my past and present state of life, since his being torn away from me; but I had the address to elude his questions, by answers that shewing his satisfaction at no great distance, won upon him to wave his impatience, in favour of the thorough confidence he had in my not delaying it; but for respects I should in good time acquaint him with.<break time="100ms" />Charles however thus return'd to my longing arms, tender, faithful, and in health, was already a blessing too mighty for my conception! but, Charles in distress!â€”Charles reduc'd, and broke down to his naked personal merit, was such a circumstance, in favour of the sentiments I had for him, as exceeded my utmost desires: and accordingly, I seem'd so visibly charm'd, so out of time, and measure pleas'd at his mention of his ruin'd fortune, that he could account for it no way but that the joy of seeing him again, had swallow'd up every other sense, or concern.<break time="100ms" />In the mean time, my woman had taken all imaginable care of Charles's travelling companion; and, as supper was coming in, he was introduc'd to me, when I receiv'd him, as became my regard for all of Charles's acquaintance, or friends.<break time="100ms" />We four then supp'd together in the stile of joy, congratulation, and pleasing disorder, that you may guess. For my part, though all these agitations had left me not the least stomach, but for that uncloying feast, the sight of my ador'd youth, I endeavour'd to force it, by way of example for him, who, I conjectur'd, must want such a recruit after riding, and indeed, he eat like a traveller; but gaz'd at, and addressed me all the time like a lover.<break time="100ms" />After the cloth was taken away, and the hour of repose came on, Charles and I were, without further ceremony, in quality of man and wife, shown up together to a very handsome apartment, and, all in course, the bed, they said, to be the best in the inn.<break time="100ms" />And here, decency forgive me! if, once more I violate thy laws, and keeping the curtains undrawn, sacrifice thee for the last time, to that confidence, without reserve, with which I engaged to recount to you the most striking circumstances of my youthful disorders.<break time="100ms" />As soon then as we were in the room together, left to ourselves, the sight of the bed starting the remembrance of our first joys, and the thought of my being instantly to share it with the dear possessor of my virgin heart, moved me so strongly, that it was well I lean'd upon him, or I must have fainted again, under the overpowering sweet alarm. Charles saw into my confusion, and forgot his own, that was scarce less, to apply himself to the removal of mine.<break time="100ms" />But now the true refining passion had regain'd thorough possession of me, with all its train of symptoms; a sweet sensibility, a tender timidity, love-sick yearnings temper'd with diffidence and modesty, all held me in a subjection of soul, incomparably dearer to me than the liberty of heart which I had been long, too long! the mistress of, in the course of those grosser gallantries, the consciousness of which now made me sigh with a virtuous confusion and regret: no real virgin in short, in view of the nuptial bed, could give more bashful blushes to unblemish'd innocence, than I did to a sense of guilt; and indeed I lov'd Charles too truly not to feel severely, that I did not deserve him.<break time="100ms" />As I kept hesitating, and disconcerted under this soft distraction, Charles, with a fond impatience, took the pains to undress me, and all I can remember, amidst the flutter and discomposure of my senses, was, some fluttering exclamations of joy and admiration, more especially at the feel of my breasts now set at liberty from my stays, and which panting and rising in tumultuous throbs, swell'd upon his dear touch, and gave it the welcome pleasure of finding them well-form'd, and unfail'd in firmness.<break time="100ms" />I was soon laid in bed, and scarce languish'd an instant for the darling partner of it, before he was undress'd and got between the sheets, with his arms clasp'd round me, giving and taking, with a gust inexpressible, a kiss of welcome, that my heart rising to my lips, stamp'd with its warmest-impression, concurring to my bliss, with that delicate and voluptuous emotion which Charles alone had the secret to excite, and which constitutes the very life, the essence of pleasure.<break time="100ms" />Mean while, two candles lighted on a side-table near us, and a joyous wood-fire, threw a light into the bed, that took from one sense of great importance to our joys, all pretext of complaining of its being shut out of its share of them: and indeed, the sight of my idolized youth, was, alone from the ardour with which I had wish'd for it, without other circumstance, a pleasure to die of.
