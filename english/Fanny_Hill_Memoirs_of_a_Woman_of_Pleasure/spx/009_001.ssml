        <break time="100ms" /><break time="100ms" />My gentleman had now put on his cloaths and recompos'd himself, when giving me a kiss, and placing me by him, he sat himself down as gingerly as possible, with one side off the cushion, which was too sore for him to bear resting any part of his weight on.<break time="100ms" />Here he thank'd me for the extreme pleasure I had procured him, and seeing perhaps some marks in my countenance of terror, and apprehension of retaliation on my own skin, for what I had been the instrument of his suffering in his, he assur'd me, he was ready to give up to me any engagement I might deem myself under to stand him, as he had done me; but that if I proceeded in my consent to it, he would consider the difference of my sex, its greater delicacy, and incapacity to undergo pain. Rehearten'd at which, and piqu'd in honour, as I thought, not to flinch so near the trial, especially, as I well knew Mrs. Cole was an eye-witness, from her stand of espial, to the whole of our transactions, I was now less afraid of my skin, than of his not furnishing me with an opportunity of signalizing my resolution.<break time="100ms" />Consonant to this disposition was my answer, but my courage was still more in my head, than in my heart, and as cowards rush into the danger they fear, in order to be the sooner rid of the pain of that sensation, I was entirely pleas'd with his hastening matters into execution.<break time="100ms" />He had then little to do, but to unloose the strings of my petticoat, and lift them, together with my shift, navel-high, where he just tuck'd them up loosely girt, and might be slipt up higher at pleasure: then viewing me round with great seeming delight, he laid me at my length, on my face, upon the bench, and when I expected he would tie me, as I had done him, and held out my hands, not without fear, and a little trembling; he told me, he would by no means terrify me unnecessarily with such a confinement; for that though he meant to put my constancy to some trial, the standing it was to be completely voluntary on my side, and therefore I was to be at full liberty to get up whenever I found the pain too much for me:——You cannot imagine how much I thought myself bound, by being thus allow'd to remain loose, and how much spirit this confidence in me, gave me, so that I was, even from my heart, careless how much my flesh might suffer in honour of it.<break time="100ms" />All my back parts naked half way up, were now fully at his mercy: and first, he stood at a convenient distance, delighting himself with a gloating survey of the attitude I lay in, and of all the secret stores I thus expos'd to him in fair display: then springing eagerly towards me, he cover'd all those naked parts with a fond confusion of kisses; and now taking hold of the rod, rather wanton'd with me, in gentle inflictions on those tender trembling masses of my flesh behind, than any way hurt them, till by degrees he began to tingle them with smarter lashes, so as to provoke a red colour into them, which I knew, as well by the flagrant glow I felt there, as by his telling me, they now emulated the native roses of my other cheeks: when he had then amus'd himself with admiring, and toying with them, he went on to strike harder, and more hard; so that I needed all my patience not to cry out, or complain at least: at last he twigg'd me so smartly as, to fetch blood in more than one lash: at sight of which, he flung down the rod, flew to me, kiss'd away the starting drops, and sucking the wounds, eas'd a good deal of my pain: but now raising me on my knees, and making me kneel with them straddling wide, that tender part of me naturally the province of pleasure, not of pain, came in for its share of suffering, for now, eying it wistfully, he directed the rod so that the sharp ends of the twigs lighted there, so sensibly, that I could not help winching, and writhing my limbs with smart; so that my contorsions of body must necessarily throw it into an infinite variety of postures, and points of view, fit to feast the luxury of the eye: but still I bore everything without crying out: when presently giving me another pause, he rush'd, as it were, on that part, whose lips, and round-about, had felt his cruelty, and by way of reparation, glews his own to them: then he open'd, shut, squeez'd them, pluck'd softly the over-growing moss, and all this in a style of wild passionate rapture, and enthusiasm, that express'd excess of pleasure, till betaking himself to the rod again, encourag'd by my passiveness, and infuriate with this strange taste of delight, he made my poor posteriours pay for the ungovernableness of it; for now shewing them no quarter, the traytor cut me so, that I wanted but very little of fainting away, when he gave over; and yet I did not utter one groan, or angry expostulation; but in my heart I resolv'd nothing so seriously, as never to expose myself again to the like severities.<break time="100ms" />You may guess then in what a curious pickle those flesh-cushions of mine were, all sore, raw, and in fine, terribly clawed off; but so far from feeling any pleasure in it, that the recent smart made me pout a little; and not with the greatest air of satisfaction, receive the compliments, and after-caresses of the author of my pain.<break time="100ms" />As soon as my cloaths were huddled on, in a little decency, a supper was brought in by the discreet Mrs. Cole herself, which might have piqued the sensuality of a cardinal, accompanied with a choice of the richest wines; all which she set before us, and went out again, without having by a word, or even by a smile, given us the least interruption, or confusion, in those instants of secrecy, that we were not yet ripe for the admission of a third to.<break time="100ms" />I sat down then, still scarce in charity with my butcher; for such I could not help considering him, and was moreover not a little piqued at the gay, satisfied air of his countenance, which I thought myself insulted by: but when the now necessary refreshment to me, of a glass of wine, and a little eating, (all the time observing a profound silence) had somewhat chear'd, and restor'd me to spirits; and as the smart began to go off, my good humour return'd accordingly, which alteration not escaping him, he said, and did every thing that could confirm me in, and indeed exalt, it.<break time="100ms" />But scarce was supper well over, before a change so incredible was wrought in me, such violent, yet pleasingly irksome sensations took possession of me, that I scarce knew how to contain myself: the smart of the lashes was now converted into such a prickly heat, such fiery tinglings, as made me sigh, squeeze my thighs together, shift and wriggle about my seat, with a furious restlessness; whilst these itching ardours thus excited in those parts on which the storm of discipline had principally fallen, detach'd legions of burning, subtile, stimulating spirits, to their opposite spot, and center of assemblage, where their titillation rag'd so furiously, that I was even stinging-mad with them: no wonder then, that in such a taking, and devour'd by flames that lick'd up all modesty and reserve, my eyes now charg'd brimful of the most intense desire, fired on my companion very intelligible signals of distress: my companion, I say, who grew in them every instant more amiable, and more necessary to my urgent wishes, and hopes of immediate ease.
