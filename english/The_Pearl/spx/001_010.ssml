        <break time="100ms" />A Cochin fowl shall rival Mabel Grey;<break time="100ms" />Nobles be rained by the Hyaena's smile,<break time="100ms" />And Seals get short engagements from th' Argyle.<break time="100ms" />Hard is her lot, that here by Fortune placed,<break time="100ms" />Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste;<break time="100ms" />Catch every whim, learn every bawdy trick,<break time="100ms" />And chase the new born bubbles of the prick;<break time="100ms" />Ah, let not Censure term our fate, our choice,<break time="100ms" />The Bawd but echoes back the public voice;<break time="100ms" />The Brothers laws, the Brothel's patrons give,<break time="100ms" />And those that live to please, must please to live;<break time="100ms" />Then purge these growing follies from your hearts,<break time="100ms" />And turn to female arms, and female arts;<break time="100ms" />'Tis yours this night, to bid the reign begin,<break time="100ms" />Of all the good old-fashioned ways to sin;<break time="100ms" />Clean, wholesome girls, with lip, tongue, cunt, and hand,<break time="100ms" />Shall raise, keep up, put in, take down a stand;<break time="100ms" />Your bottoms shall by lily hands be bled,<break time="100ms" />And birches blossom under every bed.<break time="100ms" />Air.—"Derry Down."<break time="100ms" />When Adam and Eve were first put into Eden,<break time="100ms" />They never once thought of that pleasant thing—breeding<break time="100ms" />Though they had not a rag to cover their front,<break time="100ms" />Adam sported his prick, and Eve sported her cunt.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Adam's prick was so thick and so long—such a teaser;<break time="100ms" />Eve's cunt was so hairy and fat—such a breezer;<break time="100ms" />Adam's thing was just formed any maiden to please,<break time="100ms" />And his bollocks hung down very near to his knees.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Eve played with his balls, and thought it no harm:<break time="100ms" />He fingered her quim and ne'er felt alarm;<break time="100ms" />He tickled her bubbies, she rubbed up his yard,<break time="100ms" />And yet for a fuck, why they felt no regard.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />But when Mrs. Eve did taste of the fruit,<break time="100ms" />It was then that her eyes first beheld Adam's root;<break time="100ms" />Then he ate an apple, and after he had done't,<break time="100ms" />Why then he first found out the value of cunt.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Then they say they made fig leaves, that's fiddle-de-dee.<break time="100ms" />He wanted a quim, and quite ready was she;<break time="100ms" />They gazed on their privates with mutual delight,<break time="100ms" />And she soon found a hole to put jock out of sight!<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Then Adam soon laid Mrs. Eve on the grass,<break time="100ms" />He pop't in his prick, she heaved up her arse;<break time="100ms" />He wriggled, she wiggled, they both stuck to one tether<break time="100ms" />And she tickled his balls, till they both came together!<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Since then, all her children are filled with desire,<break time="100ms" />And the women a stiff-standing prick all require!<break time="100ms" />And no son of Adam will e'er take affront,<break time="100ms" />For where is the man that can live without cunt.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Air.—"Derry Down."<break time="100ms" />There was a lass they called bonny Bet,<break time="100ms" />With a jolly fat arse, and a cunt black as jet;<break time="100ms" />Her quim had long itched, and she wanted, I vow,<break time="100ms" />A jolly good fucking, but couldn't tell how.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />She thought of a plan that might serve as the same,<break time="100ms" />That herself she might shag without any shame;<break time="100ms" />So a carrot she got, with a point rather blunt,<break time="100ms" />And she ramm'd it and jamm'd it three parts up her cunt.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />She liked it so well that she oft used to do it,<break time="100ms" />Till at length the poor girl had occasion to rue it;<break time="100ms" />For one day, when amusing herself with this whim,<break time="100ms" />The carrot it snapped, and part stuck in her quim.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />She went almost mad with vexation at this,<break time="100ms" />Indeed it was time, the poor girl couldn't piss.<break time="100ms" />The lass was in torture, no rest had poor Bet,<break time="100ms" />So at last an old doctor she was forced to get.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />The doctor he came, and she told him the case,<break time="100ms" />Then with spectacles on, and a very long face,<break time="100ms" />He bid her turn up, though she scarcely was able,<break time="100ms" />And pull up her petticoats over her navel.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Her clouts she held up, round her belly so plump,<break time="100ms" />And he gave her fat arse such a hell of a thump,<break time="100ms" />That he made her cry out, tho' he did it so neat,<break time="100ms" />And away flew the carrot bang into the street.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />Now a sweep passing by, he saw it come down,<break time="100ms" />Picked it up and he ate it, and said with a frown,<break time="100ms" />By God! it's not right, it's a damned shame, I say,<break time="100ms" />That people should throw buttered carrots away.<break time="100ms" />Derry down.<break time="100ms" />A Parody on Moore's Melody<break time="100ms" />There is not in this wide world a valley so sweet,<break time="100ms" />As that vale where the thighs of a pretty girl meet:<break time="100ms" />Oh, the last ray of feeling and life must depart,<break time="100ms" />Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart.<break time="100ms" />Yet it is not that Nature has shed o'er the scene,<break time="100ms" />The purest of red, the most delicate skin,<break time="100ms" />'Tis not the sweet smell of the genial hill;<break time="100ms" />Ah, no! it is something more exquisite still.<break time="100ms" />'Tis because the last favours of woman are there,<break time="100ms" />Which make every part of her body more dear.<break time="100ms" />We feel how the charms of Nature improve,<break time="100ms" />When we bathe in the spendings of her whom we love.<break time="100ms" />Nature, everywhere the same,<break time="100ms" />Imparts to man a lustful flame;<break time="100ms" />In Russian snow or Indian fire,<break time="100ms" />All men alike indulge desire,<break time="100ms" />All alike, feel passion's heat,<break time="100ms" />All alike, enjoyment greet,<break time="100ms" />So that wheresoe'er you go,<break time="100ms" />Still the same voluptuous glow<break time="100ms" />Throbs through every purple vein,<break time="100ms" />Thirsts enjoyment to obtain;<break time="100ms" />'Mongst the dark, or with the fair,<break time="100ms" />Woman is empress everywhere.<break time="100ms" />Pressed in the arms of him I so adored,<break time="100ms" />The keeper of my charms, my pride, my lord!<break time="100ms" />By day experiencing each sweet delight,<break time="100ms" />And meeting endless transports every night
