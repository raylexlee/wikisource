Said I: "'Twill shake the walls."<break time="100ms" />"Oh, no," said she, "that's only when great Julien shakes his ballâ€”<break time="100ms" />My bunch of rosy locks, his staff so well displayed is,<break time="100ms" />He knows full well a good long piece is sure to please the ladies."<break time="100ms" />The names of all the instruments she then enquired about<break time="100ms" />Especially of that long brass-thing that kept sliding in and out.<break time="100ms" />The fingering of the double-bass she thought was rather slack,<break time="100ms" />And wondered Julien should engage a man who'd got the clap-<break time="100ms" />Pers they were an awful bore, and still she would insist on<break time="100ms" />Me telling her who'd get the horn, and who the cornet a piston.<break time="100ms" />She said she liked the clarinet, likewise the German flute-<break time="100ms" />You know all well such instruments the ladies always suit;<break time="100ms" />The forty parts they were so off they almost made us start,<break time="100ms" />And the ophicleide would come in just like a thundering fart<break time="100ms" />Or peal of thunder, but not so far as India;<break time="100ms" />And the French horn would pop in, to join those things so windy<break time="100ms" />The place got overpowering; our ears were tired of drumming;<break time="100ms" />Said she: "I feel I'm going, you'd better be a-coming."<break time="100ms" />She took my arm, we left the place, I acted as conductor;<break time="100ms" />I called a cab, and on the road I freely furnished her with my ideas of Julien's improvements,<break time="100ms" />And so wound up with a grand duet with many pleasing movements.<break time="100ms" />My Grandmother's Tale or May's Account of Her Introduction to the Art of Love.<break time="100ms" />From an unsophisticated Manuscript found amongst the old lady's papers, after her death, supposed to have been written about A.D. 1797.<break time="100ms" />CHAPTER II.<break time="100ms" />KATE'S NARRATIVE.<break time="100ms" />You know I am a native of the West Indies. I was born in Santa Cruz, where my father had a plantation, and lots of slaves.<break time="100ms" />The little boys and girls were naked until they were eight or nine years old: I remember being greatly struck with the fine little cocks of the boys, and wondered why they differed so from girls.<break time="100ms" />The son of our overseer was just my age, about ten. He was a smart intelligent boy, and we used to play together. His name was Joe.<break time="100ms" />One day I caught him piddling and looking at his cock. I laughed and told him he ought to cut it off, it was so ugly.<break time="100ms" />He said he would be sorry for he would much rather be a man than a woman, "and when I grow to be a man," he said, "this will grow big."<break time="100ms" />"How do you know?" I said, putting my hand on it.<break time="100ms" />"Because I have often seen men naked. Do you know what a man calls it?"<break time="100ms" />"No. What?"<break time="100ms" />"He calls it a prick."<break time="100ms" />"Oh?"<break time="100ms" />"And do you know what he does with it?"<break time="100ms" />"He piddles with it, I suppose, like yourself."<break time="100ms" />"Ah!" he said, looking very sly, "he does more than that."<break time="100ms" />"What?"<break time="100ms" />"He can put it into a woman between her legs, in that queer little slit you girls have."<break time="100ms" />"There's no room for it there," I said.<break time="100ms" />"Yes there is; I'll show you if you'll let me, may I?" he said, lifting my frock.<break time="100ms" />"You may, just for a minute."<break time="100ms" />He put his fingers into my cunt and felt about for the opening. At last he found it, and, to my surprise, pushed his forefinger up.<break time="100ms" />"Stop," I cried, "that hurts."<break time="100ms" />"I won't hurt you bye-and-bye," he said, with his sly look.<break time="100ms" />"How, what do you mean?"<break time="100ms" />"I'll tell you, but mind, it's a great secret. You know Jim who has the cat and flogs the slaves when they misbehave. Well, when the women are sent, he flogs their backs; but when girls are sent he flogs their bottoms. I was near the place when a fine plump girl came from your papa with a note, which I saw afterwards. It had only these words: 'Give this girl twelve lashes. -E. L.'<break time="100ms" />"Jim brought her in and shut the door but I stole round to a window on the other side and peeped in. He had her kneel on a bench and tied her hands to the block.
