        <break time="100ms" />The kissing ceremony was over, and then Alice told him he had yet another little penance to perform before he could be admitted to full rights of membership, pointing to a fine "Berkeley Horse," which was being wheeled into the centre of the drawing-room, a thing something like a common pair of steps, only covered with red baize, and provided with a cushioned footboard for the victim to stand on, whilst his hands were well stretched above his head, so as to only allow of his standing on tiptoe. Lothair in his simple ignorance stepped up gallantly and was instantly secured by his wrists to the topmost rings of the horse.<break time="100ms" />St. Aldegonde, grinning with delight, tightened the cords unmercifully, making Lothair expostulate with him at the painful tension.<break time="100ms" />"That's nothing, my boy," said St. Aldegonde, "don't cry out before you're hurt. Wait until you feel the rods tickle and warm your posteriors, it will do you good, as it did me; it's the most invigorating thing in the world; ask Bertha if I did not give her all she required that night."<break time="100ms" />All the company were now furnished with beautiful bunches of long thin elegantly tied-up birch.<break time="100ms" />Alice, stepping to the front.- "Now, sir, mind you answer all my questions under pain of severe punishment. In the first place none but orthodox members of the English Church can be admitted to the Paphian Circle, and a member has just hinted to me that you are going to Rome, and may be a Jesuit in disguise. Now, my Lord, what do you say to that?" giving his bottom a smart cut, which made him wince with pain, and left a long red mark across the white skin of his manly buttocks.<break time="100ms" />Lothair.- "My God! you punish without waiting." Before he could finish speaking all the ladies attacked him with their rods, raining a perfect shower of painful cuts on his helpless bottom, exclaiming, "Answer! Answer!! Answer!!! No prevarication! Don't spare him! andc," whilst the gentlemen, who stood behind, cut into the fair bottoms of their partners, calling out, "Pass it on to him; cut away, ladies; he's a Jesuit, andc."<break time="100ms" />Lothair at first lost his breath, but soon shouted out lustily, "Hold! Hold!! It's not true! Don't kill me!"<break time="100ms" />His bottom and back were scored all over, and little drops of blood trickled down from places where the skin was broken.<break time="100ms" />Alice.- "Well, my Lord, pray excuse our virtuous indignation, if you are not really a Jesuit. But how about a Cathedral you intend to build for them, eh?" cutting him several deliberate strokes as she was speaking, each one making him quiver under its smarting force.<break time="100ms" />Lothair.- "Oh! My God! How do you know that? I've only had the plans drawn."<break time="100ms" />Alice.- "But, my Lord, allow me to drive the thoughts of such a foolish thing from your mind. Can you not think of some better applications for your money? Will you promise me not to make yourself a fool?" cutting harder and harder every moment, till he fairly howled with pain, ejaculating,-<break time="100ms" />"Ah! Oh! Damme! How cruel of you Miss Marchmont! Ah - for God's sake let me off now. I - I - won't do it; I give my word for that."<break time="100ms" />Alice.- "Beg my pardon instantly, my Lord, or you shall feel what cruelty really is like. Cruel indeed! to a young lady who is only doing a painful duty!" catching hold of a fresh rod, and slashing his bleeding bottom with all her might.<break time="100ms" />Lothair writhes his body about in dreadful pain, and his fine cock stands out rampantly in front, in a most outrageous state of stiffness, the head quite purple from the extraordinary pressure of blood which distended it. "Ah! ah! oh! oh! I do beg your pardon, I'm sure you will forgive me, and let me off now," he groaned in agony.<break time="100ms" />Alice.- "I've only a trifling thing to ask you, now you have apologized. My duty is far more painful and disagreeable to me than it can possibly be to you; bodily suffering cannot for a moment be compared to anguish of mind," as she still cuts into his raw-looking posteriors, and looks round delightedly on the spectators for encouragement, then goes on again. "If you're not going to build that Cathedral, will you devote a fourth part of what it would have cost to the building of a proper temple for the meetings of our Paphian Circle?"<break time="100ms" />Lothair, gasping in pain.- "Ok! Oh! Yes! That I will, Â£50,000, if you will let me down at once!"<break time="100ms" />There was a general clapping of hands all round, and cries of, "Enough! Enough! He's a good boy now," and then there was a scuffle all round to secure victims, which were mostly of the weaker sex, but Ladies Bertha and Victoria, by the aid of diplomacy, had got both their husbands prisoners on a sofa, and lashing into them most unmercifully, laughing and shrieking out, "Keep the game alive! Keep the game alive!"<break time="100ms" />Alice had meanwhile let down poor Lothair, who was into her in a moment, to the dear girl's great delight, both of them frequently spending and screaming with ecstasy.<break time="100ms" />My partner threw me across his knee, and made my bottom smart under his loud slaps. I screamed and struggled desperately, and at last equalized matters by grasping his stiff cock, and making him feel that two could play at the game of inflicting pain. He cried a truce, and I speedily righted myself, sitting up with my bottom in his lap, and his pego right up into my vitals. He clasped his arms round me, taking one globe of my bosom in each hand, which he moulded delightfully with his fingers as I rose and fell on his tight-fitting shaft, leaning back my head so as to meet his kisses and give him my tongue. This was a delicious position, his spendings seemed to shoot with extraordinary force into my womb, and my own helped to make quite a stream of sperm, which spurted all over his thighs at each insertion, and fairly drowned the hair round the roots of his pego.<break time="100ms" />St. Aldegonde and Montairy were having each other's wives for a change after their whipping, but cunt seemed decidedly at a discount with them, as each of them was indulging in a bottom-fuck, which those ladies seemed to relish immensely, and to add to the voluptuous excitement of the scene, the darling Corisande struck up "They a' Do't" to the tune of "A man's a man for a' that"<break time="100ms" />The grit folk an' the puir do't,<break time="100ms" />The blyte folk and the sour do't,<break time="100ms" />The black, the white,<break time="100ms" />Rude an' polite,<break time="100ms" />Baith autocrat an' boor do't.<break time="100ms" />For they a' do't - they a' do't,<break time="100ms" />The beggars an' the braw do't,<break time="100ms" />Folk that ance were, and folk that are-<break time="100ms" />The folk that come will a' do't.<break time="100ms" />The auld folk try't,<break time="100ms" />The young ane's do't,<break time="100ms" />The blind, the lame,<break time="100ms" />The wild, the tame,<break time="100ms" />In warm climes an' cauld do't,<break time="100ms" />For they a' do't, andc.<break time="100ms" />The licensed by the law do't,<break time="100ms" />Forbidden folk and a' do't,<break time="100ms" />And priest and nun<break time="100ms" />Enjoy the fun,<break time="100ms" />And never once say nay to't.
